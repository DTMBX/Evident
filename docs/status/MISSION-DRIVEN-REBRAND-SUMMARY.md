## 💬 Website Copy to Use

### Homepage Hero

```
Legal Research for Everyone

Professional-grade case law, citation analysis, and AI-powered research—
at 1/10th the cost of Westlaw and LexisNexis

10M+ Opinions | 270 Years | 20x Cheaper

[Start Free Trial] [Our Mission]
```

### Mission Statement

```
Why Evident Exists

Legal research shouldn't cost $2,000 per month.

For decades, Westlaw and LexisNexis have charged prices that exclude
solo practitioners, bankrupt legal aid organizations, and widen the
justice gap.

We're changing that.

Evident provides research-grade tools—10M+ opinions, Shepard's-equivalent
citations, judge intelligence, AI search—for $50/month.

Because justice shouldn't require a trust fund.
```

### Value Proposition

```
Same Tools as BigLaw. 20x Cheaper.

✅ 10M+ federal opinions (Westlaw has same)
✅ Shepard's-equivalent citations (KeyCite equivalent)
✅ Judge intelligence (backgrounds, voting patterns)
✅ AI legal assistant (ChatGPT integration)
✅ Free PACER alternative (no $0.10/page fees)

$50/month vs. Westlaw's $2,000/month
Save $23,400/year
```
