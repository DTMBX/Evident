Subject: OPRA Request – Surety Bonds, Insurance, and Police Claims

Dear Records Custodian,

I, Devon Tyler of the Barber family, a private New Jerseyan, formally request access to public records under the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA), N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq.

Records Requested:
	1.	Surety Bond & Officer Bond Information
	•	Certified copies of all surety bonds and individual officer bonds for Hamilton Township Police Department (HTPD) officers, including Officer Stephen Boyd, the Chief of Police, and all sworn personnel.
	•	Documentation of the bonding company, underwriters, and policy terms indemnifying officers for misconduct, civil rights violations, or injuries under color of law.
	•	Records of any bond forfeitures, claims, or investigations against any HTPD officers from the past seven years.
	2.	Police Liability Insurance Policies
	•	Copies of all general liability, professional liability, and public official liability insurance policies covering HTPD officers.
	•	Coverage limits, exclusions, and claims processes for misconduct or injury claims.
	3.	Municipal Self-Insurance & Risk Management
	•	Records indicating whether Hamilton Township self-insures its officers or participates in a Joint Insurance Fund (JIF) or municipal insurance program.
	•	Copies of indemnification agreements covering officers in both official and personal capacities.
	4.	Police Claims & Settlements History
	•	A record of all claims filed, paid, or settled involving misconduct, excessive force, or injuries caused by HTPD officers in the last seven years.

Format & Compliance:

I request these records in electronic format (PDF or digital copies) as required under OPRA. If any portion of this request is exempt, provide redacted copies rather than withholding entire documents.

Private Citizen Status & Fee Waiver:

This request is made in the public interest and for lawful due process. As I am not acting in a commercial capacity, I request a fee waiver as permitted under OPRA for non-commercial inquiries.

Please confirm receipt and provide an estimated fulfillment timeline per OPRA deadlines. If clarification is needed, contact me directly.

Best regards,
Devon Tyler of the Barber family.
