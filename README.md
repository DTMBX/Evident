# BarberX Legal Technologies (BXLT)

**BarberX Legal Technologies** is a local-first legal-tech platform for processing, analyzing, and organizing digital evidence in civil-rights and constitutional litigation.

The system is designed to help litigants, advocates, and legal teams work with **body-worn camera footage, discovery documents, and public-records data** in a way that preserves **evidentiary integrity, transparency, and chain of custody**—without reliance on cloud processing.

> Evidence is processed locally. Originals are preserved. Analysis is reproducible.

## Purpose & Design Principles

BarberX is built around several non-negotiable principles:

- **Local-first processing**  
  Evidence remains on the user’s system unless explicitly shared.

- **Integrity over automation**  
  The platform assists analysis; it does not replace legal judgment.

- **Chain of custody awareness**  
  Originals are immutable. Derivatives are traceable.

- **Civil-rights focused workflows**  
  Optimized for constitutional, public-accountability, and discovery review contexts.

- **Transparency and auditability**  
  Processing steps are inspectable and reproducible.
