# Approximate frost-date ranges by USDA zone.
# IMPORTANT: USDA hardiness zones are NOT frost dates; these are broad planning estimates.
# Verify locally by ZIP code or county extension office.
# Source example of zone-based averages (use as planning only): American Meadows chart; NOAA defines first freeze concepts and climate normals.
