  ## Case Overview

This matter consists of consolidated **Post-Conviction Relief (PCR)** proceedings brought by **Devon Tyler Barber** under **Rule 3:22**, challenging a 2022 conviction adjudicated in Atlantic County. The origins of this case trace back to a wage dispute between Barber and his former employers. The PCR petitions relate to matters commonly referenced as the *Hardemon* cases and are consolidated here to ensure a unified record and consistent judicial review.

Petitioner alleges that the conviction and subsequent proceedings were tainted by due-process violations, failures of notice, deficiencies in the record, and ineffective assistance of counsel, resulting in an unreliable adjudication. It is further asserted that Barber's former employers engaged in improper and retaliatory conduct during the underlying proceedings, contributing to the alleged injustices and procedural irregularities.

## Grounds Asserted

The PCR petitions assert, among other grounds:

* **Denial of due process**, including lack of proper notice and opportunity to be heard;
* **Ineffective assistance of counsel**, including failure to challenge jurisdictional and procedural defects;
* **Record integrity failures**, including missing, inaccurate, or untransmitted materials;
* **Fundamental fairness violations** impacting the validity of the conviction and sentence.

These claims are asserted pursuant to **Rule 3:22-2(a)** and related provisions.
