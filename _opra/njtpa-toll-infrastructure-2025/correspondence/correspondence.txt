  NEW JERSEY OPEN PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST

NJ Transportation Planning Authority – Toll Infrastructure Planning, Gantry Deployment, Ownership Disclosures, and Resident Cost Impacts

Dear OPRA Custodian,
New Jersey Department of Transportation (New Jersey Transportation Planning Authority),

Please accept this electronic request for public records pursuant to the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA), N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq., and the common-law right of access.

Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-6(f), this email constitutes a valid OPRA request. No agency-specific form or software platform is required.

This request is made:
	•	for public-interest and informational purposes only,
	•	not for any commercial use, and
	•	not to interfere with any pending legal proceeding.

STATEMENT OF PUBLIC INTEREST

NJDOT’s transportation planning authority makes decisions that shape how New Jersey residents travel, the infrastructure deployed on public roadways, and the long-term costs borne by ordinary motorists.

Recent expansions of gantry-based, camera-enabled toll infrastructure and automated tolling systems raise significant public-interest questions concerning:
	•	planning justification versus resident burden,
	•	long-term capital and debt assumptions,
	•	coordination with toll authorities and private vendors, and
	•	whether residents traveling for daily life—rather than profit—are bearing disproportionate costs.

Residents are entitled to transparency regarding why these systems are planned, who benefits, and what alternatives were considered.

RECORDS CUSTODIAN & CONTROL

This request is directed to NJDOT’s Transportation Planning Authority as custodian of records relating to statewide transportation planning, capital planning coordination, and infrastructure policy.

If responsive records are created, received, relied upon, or controlled by NJDOT, they are subject to OPRA regardless of whether another agency or contractor physically maintains them.

If you are not the proper custodian for any portion, please forward this request and identify the appropriate custodian.

TIMEFRAME

January 1, 2020 to present, unless otherwise stated.
