**Integration Points:**

- ✅ Homepage (`/` - index-standalone.html)
- ✅ Dashboard (`/dashboard` - dashboard.html)
- ✅ Honor Wall (`/honor` - honor.html)

Let the header stand as witness.
```

**Technical Implementation:**

### 2. Elite Legal Research Library (Law Firm Grade)

**Objective:** Make Evident the **go-to platform** for constitutional law firms handling BWC cases.

#### Professional Legal Research Tools Section

**Integrated Resources:**

1. **Supreme Court Cases (Justia)**
   - Direct link: https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/
   - Complete database of SCOTUS opinions
   - Free access for legal professionals

2. **CourtListener - Free Case Law**
   - Direct link: https://www.courtlistener.com/
   - 4+ million opinions
   - Advanced search with BWC-specific queries pre-built

3. **Cornell LII Supreme Court**
   - Direct link: https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/search/
   - Constitutional law annotations
   - Cross-referenced with amendments

4. **Constitution Annotated (Congress.gov)**
   - Direct link: https://constitution.congress.gov/
   - Official congressional research
   - Case law organized by constitutional provision

#### BWC Constitutional Law Integration

**Why This Matters:** Every body-worn camera recording is a Fourth Amendment event. Evident now provides instant access to the constitutional framework needed to analyze BWC footage for rights violations.

**4th Amendment - Search & Seizure**

- Full constitutional text displayed
- **BWC Analysis Context:** "Was there probable cause? Was the search reasonable? Did officers violate rights?"
- **Evident AI Integration:** "Evident analyzes BWC footage specifically for Fourth Amendment violations using AI-powered transcript analysis and legal research."
- **Case Law Links:**
  - Cornell Wex: Fourth Amendment overview
  - CourtListener: Pre-built search for "fourth amendment police body camera"
  - Evident Archive: Direct link to full Bill of Rights text

**5th Amendment - Due Process & Self-Incrimination**

- Full constitutional text displayed
- **BWC Analysis Context:** "Were Miranda rights given? Did police coerce statements? Did the defendant invoke their right to remain silent?"
- **Evident AI Integration:** "BWC footage often contains the most critical evidence of Fifth Amendment violations. Evident's AI transcription identifies Miranda warnings, identifies coercion patterns, and flags self-incrimination issues."
- **Case Law Links:**
  - Cornell Wex: Fifth Amendment overview
  - Miranda v. Arizona (1966) full opinion
  - CourtListener: "fifth amendment miranda police interrogation" search
  - Evident Archive: Bill of Rights Amendment 5

**14th Amendment - Equal Protection & Due Process**

- Full constitutional text displayed
- **BWC Analysis Context:** "The 14th Amendment incorporated most of the Bill of Rights to apply against state and local police. It also prohibits discriminatory policing."
- **Evident AI Integration:** "BWC analysis can reveal patterns of unequal treatment based on race, ethnicity, or other protected characteristics. Evident's pattern analysis tools help identify systemic constitutional violations."
- **Case Law Links:**
  - Cornell Wex: Fourteenth Amendment overview
  - CourtListener: "fourteenth amendment equal protection police" search
  - Evident Archive: Amendments section

#### Landmark Supreme Court Cases for BWC Defense

**Terry v. Ohio (1968) - Stop and Frisk**

- **Citation:** 392 U.S. 1 (1968)
- **Standard:** "Reasonable suspicion" for stops and pat-downs
- **BWC Critical:** "Did officers have reasonable, articulable suspicion before the stop? Evident analyzes officer statements in BWC footage to determine if Terry requirements were met."
- **Links:** Full Justia opinion + CourtListener analysis

**Miranda v. Arizona (1966) - Custodial Interrogation**

- **Citation:** 384 U.S. 436 (1966)
- **Requirement:** Police must inform suspects of rights before custodial interrogation
- **BWC Critical:** "Was Miranda warning given? Was defendant in custody? Evident's AI automatically detects Miranda warnings and flags interrogations without proper advisement."
- **Links:** Full Justia opinion + CourtListener analysis

**Graham v. Connor (1989) - Use of Force**

- **Citation:** 490 U.S. 386 (1989)
- **Standard:** "Objective reasonableness" for police use of force under 4th Amendment
- **BWC Critical:** "Was force objectively reasonable from officer's perspective? Evident analyzes force incidents frame-by-frame with constitutional standards."
- **Links:** Full Justia opinion + CourtListener analysis
