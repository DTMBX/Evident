## Email #1: Initial Outreach to Clinical Professor

**Subject:** Free Partnership Proposal: AI-Powered BWC Analysis for [Law School]
Criminal Defense Clinic

**To:** [Clinical Professor Name]

**Body:**

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I'm reaching out from Evident Legal Technologies with a partnership proposal for
[Law School]'s Criminal Defense Clinic.

**Who We Are:**

Evident is an AI-powered platform that automates body-worn camera (BWC) analysis
for criminal defense cases. We reduce analysis time by 85% (from 20 hours to 2
hours per case) through automated transcription, timeline reconstruction, and
discrepancy detection.

**Why This Matters for Your Clinic:**

Your students likely handle cases with 8-12 hours of BWC footage. Manual
analysis is: • Time-consuming (taking away from legal strategy and client
counseling) • Error-prone (easy to miss critical 3-second discrepancies) •
Overwhelming (students juggling cases + coursework + exams)

Evident automates the tedious work so students can focus on legal reasoning and
advocacy.

**Partnership Proposal (100% Free):**

We'd like to offer [Law School]'s Criminal Defense Clinic:

1. **Free PROFESSIONAL-tier access** for all clinic students and supervising
   attorneys (Normally $49/month per user—we'll provide unlimited free access)

2. **Training workshop** (1-2 hours):
   - How to analyze BWC evidence effectively
   - Legal standards for BWC admissibility (authentication, Brady, spoliation)
   - Hands-on Evident demo with real clinic cases
   - Q&A with students

3. **Academic collaboration** (optional):
   - Co-author case study: "Using AI to Analyze BWC Evidence in [Clinic Case]"
   - Student testimonials for Evident website (with permission)
   - Citation in academic publications or blog posts

**What We're Asking in Return:**

1. **Feedback:** Share your experience using Evident (what works, what could
   improve)
2. **Case study:** One anonymized success story we can share with other law
   schools
3. **Testimonial:** Quote from you or a student for our website
4. **Logo use:** Permission to list [Law School] as a partner on
   Evident.info/partners

**No Financial Commitment. No Catch.**

This is a free educational partnership. We believe legal education should
prepare students for real-world technology they'll use in practice. Evident is
that technology.

**Why We're Doing This:**

1. **Social Impact:** Clinical students represent underserved clients who need
   the best defense possible
2. **Future Users:** Students who use Evident in clinic often subscribe when
   they graduate
3. **Research:** We learn from clinic feedback and improve our platform

**Next Steps:**

Would you be open to a 20-minute Zoom call to discuss this partnership?

I'm available: • [Date/Time Option 1] • [Date/Time Option 2] • [Date/Time Option
3]

Or suggest a time: [Calendly link]

I've attached a one-page partnership deck with more details.

Thank you for the incredible work you do training the next generation of defense
attorneys. I'd be honored to support your clinic's mission.

## Email #2: Follow-Up (7 Days Later)

**Subject:** Re: Free Partnership for [Law School] Criminal Defense Clinic

**Body:**

Hi Professor [Last Name],

I wanted to follow up on my partnership proposal from last week.

I know semester schedules are hectic, so I'll keep this short:

**Quick Question:** Would your clinic students benefit from a tool that analyzes
8 hours of BWC footage in 45 minutes instead of manually reviewing it over 120+
hours?

If yes, I'd love to gift your clinic **free access** (normally $49/month per
student).

**Zero cost. Zero obligation. Just a resource to help your students.**

Available for a quick call this week: • [Time slots]

If this isn't a fit, no worries—just let me know and I'll stop reaching out.

Best,

Devon

## Email #3: Value-Add Follow-Up (14 Days Later)

**Subject:** Free CLE Resource for Your Clinic Students

**Body:**

Hi Professor [Last Name],

Even if the partnership isn't the right timing, I wanted to share something
useful for your clinic.

I've created a **free CLE-worthy guide (PDF):**

**"BWC Analysis Best Practices for Defense Attorneys"**

Content: ✓ 7-step analysis framework  
✓ Legal standards (authentication, hearsay, Brady, spoliation)  
✓ Common discrepancies prosecutors miss  
✓ Cross-examination techniques using BWC

Download: [Link]

**No strings attached**—just a resource your students might find helpful.

Feel free to share it in clinic seminar or include in student materials.

If you ever want to revisit the partnership, I'm here.

Best,

**Devon Tyler Barber**

## Email #4: Student Success Story (30 Days Later)

**Subject:** Case Study: Law Student Uses AI to Win "Unwinnable" Case

**Body:**

Hi Professor [Last Name],

I wanted to share a success story from another law school clinic that might
interest you.

**The Case:** 3L clinic student representing client charged with resisting
arrest

**The Challenge:** 12 hours of BWC footage, prosecution claiming client "struck
officer"

**The Outcome:** Student used Evident to find 3-second discrepancy proving
officer's injury was self-inflicted. Charges dismissed.

**Student's comment:**

> "Without Evident, I would have spent 200+ hours reviewing footage and still
> missed this. Now I have time to focus on oral arguments and client
> counseling."

Full case study (anonymized): [Link]

This is the kind of outcome [Law School] clinic students could achieve with the
right tools.

Still interested in exploring free access for your clinic? Let me know.

Best,

Devon

## Email #5: Faculty Research Collaboration (45 Days Later)

**Subject:** Research Opportunity: AI in Legal Education

**Body:**

Hi Professor [Last Name],

I've reached out a few times about partnering with [Law School]'s clinic, but
thought I'd pivot to a different opportunity.

**Research Collaboration Idea:**

Would you be interested in co-authoring a paper or article on:

**"The Role of AI in Clinical Legal Education: Using Body-Worn Camera Analysis
Tools to Enhance Student Learning"**

**Potential research questions:**

- Does AI-powered analysis improve student understanding of evidence evaluation?
- How does automating tedious tasks (transcription) free up time for
  higher-level learning?
- What are the ethical considerations of teaching students to use AI tools?

**What I'd contribute:**

- Free Evident access for your clinic (for research purposes)
- Data on student usage patterns
- Co-authorship credit
- Conference presentation support (AALS, SEALS, regional conferences)

**Potential publication outlets:**

- Clinical Law Review
- Journal of Legal Education
- Legal Writing Journal

This could be valuable for both of us:

- You: Publishable research + free tool for clinic
- Me: Academic credibility + improved product based on clinic feedback

Interested? Let's set up a call to brainstorm.

Best,

## Email #6: Final Outreach (60 Days Later)

**Subject:** Checking In One Last Time

**Body:**

Hi Professor [Last Name],

I've reached out several times about partnering with [Law School]'s clinic, but
haven't heard back.

I totally understand—you're teaching, supervising students, publishing, and
juggling a hundred other priorities.

**Before I close the loop:**

1. Is this something you'd consider in the future (maybe fall semester 2026)?
2. Should I connect with someone else (e.g., clinic director, associate dean)?

If it's a hard pass, no worries—I'll stop reaching out. Just want to make sure
I'm not missing an opportunity to support your students.

Thanks for your time, and keep up the amazing work training future public
defenders and civil rights attorneys.

Best,

**Devon Tyler Barber**

## Alternative Approach: Legal Aid Organizations

**Subject:** Free Partnership: AI-Powered BWC Analysis for [Legal Aid
Organization]

**To:** [Executive Director / Legal Director]

**Body:**

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out from Evident Legal Technologies with a partnership proposal for
[Legal Aid Organization].

**Who We Are:**

Evident is an AI-powered platform that helps defense attorneys analyze body-worn
camera footage 85% faster (from 20 hours to 2 hours per case).

**Why Legal Aid Organizations Need This:**

Your attorneys are handling 100+ cases simultaneously with limited resources.
BWC evidence is becoming ubiquitous, but manual analysis is: • Time-prohibitive
(15-20 hours per video) • Error-prone (easy to miss critical discrepancies) •
Expensive (forensic experts cost $2,000-5,000 per case)

**Partnership Proposal:**

**100% Free Access for All [Organization] Attorneys**

We'll provide unlimited PROFESSIONAL-tier access (normally $49/month per
attorney) at no cost.

**Why We're Doing This:**

1. **Mission Alignment:** Legal aid clients deserve the same forensic tools as
   wealthy defendants
2. **Social Impact:** Every wrongful conviction prevented = justice served
3. **Feedback Loop:** Legal aid attorneys handle high-volume cases and provide
   invaluable product insights

**What We're Asking:**

1. **Feedback:** Share what works and what doesn't
2. **Case study:** One anonymized success story (e.g., "Legal aid attorney uses
   AI to find discrepancy, client freed")
3. **Testimonial:** Quote for our website
4. **Logo use:** Permission to list [Organization] as a partner

**No Financial Obligation. Ever.**

This is a permanent free partnership for legal aid organizations serving
underserved communities.

**Next Steps:**

20-minute call to discuss setup and training?

Available: • [Time slots]

Or book here: [Calendly link]

Thank you for the critical work you do defending those who can't afford
representation.
