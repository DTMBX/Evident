## WHY THE BILL OF RIGHTS MATTERS

**Historical Purpose:**

- Anti-Federalists demanded protection from federal power
- Constitution originally lacked explicit rights protections
- Bill of Rights was condition for ratification

**Enduring Importance:**

- Protects individual liberty against government
- Limits federal power
- Preserves state sovereignty
- Recognizes natural rights

**Evident Mission:** These rights are what we defend in every case:

- 1st Amendment - Religious freedom, speech
- 4th Amendment - Search and seizure (BWC cases)
- 5th Amendment - Due process, self-incrimination
- 6th Amendment - Right to counsel, fair trial
- 8th Amendment - No cruel punishment

---

## INCORPORATION DOCTRINE

**14th Amendment (1868) Extended Bill of Rights to States:**

Originally, Bill of Rights only limited federal government. Through
"incorporation doctrine," Supreme Court applied most protections to states via
14th Amendment Due Process Clause.

**Incorporated Rights (Applied to States):**

- ✅ 1st Amendment - All protections (religion, speech, press, assembly,
  petition)
- ✅ 2nd Amendment - Right to bear arms (_McDonald_, 2010)
- ❌ 3rd Amendment - NOT incorporated (rarely litigated)
- ✅ 4th Amendment - Search and seizure protections
- ✅ 5th Amendment - Due process, self-incrimination, double jeopardy (NOT grand
  jury requirement)
- ✅ 6th Amendment - All fair trial protections
- ❌ 7th Amendment - NOT incorporated (civil jury trial)
- ✅ 8th Amendment - Cruel and unusual punishment, excessive bail/fines
- ✅ 9th Amendment - Interpreted as protecting unenumerated rights
- ✅ 10th Amendment - Federalism principles (limits federal power)

## PRESERVATION NOTES

**Transcription Accuracy:** Manually transcribed from National Archives official
text. Original 18th-century spelling and punctuation preserved.

**Why Exact Text Matters:** Constitutional interpretation depends on precise
wording. Supreme Court cases hinge on individual words ("the people," "shall not
be infringed," "due process").

**Living vs. Original Intent:**

- **Originalists:** Interpret based on 1791 meaning
- **Living Constitution:** Interpret based on evolving standards

**Evident Position:** We preserve the original text and let courts interpret.
Our role is to defend rights as currently understood while maintaining
historical accuracy.

**Preserved on Evident Legal Technologies**  
**January 27, 2026**

**"The enumeration of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage
others retained by the people."**
