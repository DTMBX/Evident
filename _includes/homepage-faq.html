  <!-- THEOLOGY / TEMPLE LANGUAGE (LEGAL-SAFE) -->
  <section class="ff-section" aria-labelledby="ff-theology-title">
    <h2 id="ff-theology-title" class="ff-h2">A brief note on language</h2>

    <article class="ff-faq">
      <h3>Why does Faith Frontier use “temple” language?</h3>
      <p>
        In Christian theology, Scripture teaches that God’s people are His
        temple—that He dwells within His people and forms them for holy living
        (1 Corinthians 3:16–17; 1 Peter 2:5).
      </p>
      <p>
        When Faith Frontier uses “temple” language, it is a statement of
        <strong>religious belief and spiritual identity</strong>. It is
        <strong>not</strong> a claim of legal status, tax treatment, regulatory
        exemption, or jurisdictional authority. Any civil classification is
        determined separately by applicable law, filings, and competent
        authorities.
      </p>
      <p class="ff-faq-note">
        We affirm lawful process and public accountability; religious language
        does not replace statutes, courts, agencies, or due process.
      </p>
    </article>

    <div
      class="ff-callout"
      role="note"
      aria-label="Theological language clarification"
    >
      <p class="ff-callout__text">
        In Christian theology, Scripture teaches that the people of God are the
        temple—that God dwells not in buildings alone, but within His people (1
        Corinthians 3:16–17). When Faith Frontier uses “temple” language, it is
        expressing a biblical understanding of spiritual identity, not making a
        legal, regulatory, or tax-related claim. Civil status is determined
        separately by applicable law.
