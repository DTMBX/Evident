# Court-Defensible eDiscovery Platform - Complete Documentation

## 📋 Overview

The BarberX eDiscovery Platform is a **complete court-defensible evidence management system** designed specifically for civil rights litigation against law enforcement agencies.

**Built to withstand Daubert challenges and meet Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1) compliance.**

---

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

### 1. Defensible Collection & Chain of Custody

**Evidence Vault** (`evidence_vault_service.py`)
- ✅ SHA-256 hashing at ingestion with verification
- ✅ WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many) immutable storage
- ✅ Complete chain-of-custody logging (every access, export, processing)
- ✅ Role-based access control (Attorney, Paralegal, Investigator, Expert, Restricted)
- ✅ Litigation hold management with audit trails
- ✅ Provenance tracking (source system, export method, custodian, collection date)

**Key Features:**
- Files are read-only after ingestion (simulates WORM storage)
- Hash verified before AND after vault storage
- Every event logged with user, timestamp, IP, workstation
- Printable chain-of-custody reports for court

### 2. BWC & Video Processing

**BWC Processor** (`bwc_processor_service.py`)
- ✅ Native format support: Axon Evidence.com, WatchGuard 4RE, Motorola, Vievu, Panasonic
- ✅ Time-sync normalization (device clock drift correction)
- ✅ Audio diarization (speaker separation: Officer vs Civilian)
- ✅ ASR transcription with word-level timestamps and confidence scores
- ✅ Scene/object detection: handcuffs, takedowns, flashlights, patrol car interior
- ✅ GPS/telemetry extraction (where embedded)
- ✅ Auto-chapter generation: arrival, commands, cuffing, transport, station

**Production-Ready Integrations:**
- OpenAI Whisper for ASR
- pyannote.audio for diarization
- OpenCV/YOLO for scene detection
- AssemblyAI or AWS Transcribe as alternatives

### 3. CAD/Dispatch Processing

**CAD Processor** (`cad_processor_service.py`)
- ✅ Structured imports: Spillman, VersaTerm, TriTech, Tyler New World, CJIS, Motorola PremierOne
- ✅ Event log parsing: call received, dispatched, en route, on scene, cleared, tow requested
- ✅ MDT query extraction: NCIC, DMV, warrant checks, registration lookups
- ✅ Timestamp cross-validation with BWC/tow invoices/station logs
- ✅ **Negative evidence handling**: "no responsive records" tracking with OPRA response hashing
- ✅ Discrepancy reporting: flags backdating, clock errors, falsification

**Critical Feature: Negative Evidence Database**
```excel
Evidence_Type | Case_ID | Request_Date | Response_Date | Responding_Agency |
Responding_Custodian | Request_Scope | Response_Text | Attached_File | Verification_Hash
```

Example: ACPO OPRA response "possesses no responsive records for CAD/dispatch/call-for-service" → **stored as evidence** with SHA-256 hash of response letter.

### 4. Document Discovery Processing

**Document Processor** (`document_processor_service.py`)
- ✅ OCR with text-layer repair (Tesseract/AWS Textract/Google Vision)
- ✅ Metadata extraction: author, created/modified dates, producer, attachments
- ✅ Near-duplicate detection (MD5 hashing + fuzzy matching)
- ✅ Bates stamping with configurable prefixes (DEF, PLT, CONF, AEO)
- ✅ Redaction management with persistent audit logs
- ✅ PDF XMP metadata extraction

**Redaction Audit Trail:**
Every redaction logged with:
- Page number
- Coordinates (x, y, width, height)
- Reason (Privacy, Privileged, Irrelevant)
- Applied by (user name)
- Applied date
- Review required flag

### 5. Unified Search & Analytics

**Unified Search Service** (`ediscovery_platform_service.py`)
- ✅ Cross-media queries: search transcripts, PDFs, CAD logs, emails in one query
- ✅ Controlled vocabulary aligned to claims:
  - stop_initiation, stop_duration, arrest_announcement, force_escalation
  - tow_authorization, post_tow_notice, commands_contradictory
  - internal_comms, opra_handling, brady_material
- ✅ Entity extraction: persons, officers, vehicles, locations, agencies
- ✅ Relationship mapping: officer → vehicle → civilian → location
- ✅ **Master chronology builder**: unified timeline with exact citations

**Chronology Output:**
```
Timestamp | Event | Source | Evidence_ID | Citation | Actors | Significance
2025-01-22 14:30:22 | Unit On Scene | CAD | EV-123 | CAD #25-001 | Officer Smith | High
2025-01-22 14:30:25 | BWC Activated | BWC | EV-124 | BWC @ 0:00 | Officer Smith | Critical
2025-01-22 14:31:15 | Exit Order Given | BWC | EV-124 | BWC @ 0:53 | Officer Smith | High
```

### 6. Production & Export

  - Upscaling (720p → 1080p → 4K with Lanczos/AI-ESRGAN)
  - Stabilization (reduce camera shake)
  - Sharpening (improve clarity)
  - Denoising (reduce video grain/noise)
  - Contrast enhancement
- ✅ Image enhancement:
  - Super-resolution (2x, 4x upscaling)
  - Clarity enhancement (unsharp masking)
  - Contrast adjustment
  - Brightness normalization

**Quality Levels:**
- **Minimal**: Subtle enhancement, maximum authenticity (always court-admissible)
- **Moderate**: Balanced enhancement/authenticity (court-admissible with disclosure)
- **Aggressive**: Maximum enhancement (may affect admissibility, use caution)

**Quality Metrics Tracked:**
- Audio: Signal-to-noise ratio (dB), dynamic range, clarity score
- Video/Image: Sharpness score, contrast ratio, brightness, resolution
- Enhancement improvement score (0.0 to 1.0)

**Court Defensibility:**
- Original always preserved in immutable vault
- Enhanced version created as separate derivative work
- Complete processing settings logged (noise reduction dB, algorithms used, etc.)
- Before/after quality metrics computed
- SHA-256 hash of both original and enhanced versions
- Enhancement logged in chain-of-custody
- Court admissibility flag set based on quality level
- Side-by-side comparison reports available

### 8. Automation & Monitoring

**Monitoring Service** (`ediscovery_platform_service.py`)

- ✅ Rule-based alerts:
  - New BWC received
  - New CAD export
  - New tow invoice
  - New OPRA response
  - Timestamp discrepancy detected
  - Retention deadline approaching
- ✅ Coverage dashboards: what you have vs what's missing

## 🎓 Court Credibility Features

### 1. Audit Trails You Can Print

Every action logged with:
- User name and role
- Timestamp (UTC ISO format)
- IP address (optional)
- Workstation ID (optional)
- Action description
- Hash before/after (for processing)
- Notes field

**Printable Reports:**
- Chain of Custody Report (per evidence item)
- Access Log Report (all access events)
- Processing Log Report (OCR versions, ASR models, settings)
- Verification Report (hash integrity checks)

### 2. Reproducible Processing

**Documentation of:**
- OCR engine version (Tesseract 5.3.0, AWS Textract, etc.)
- ASR model version (Whisper large-v3, AssemblyAI, etc.)
- Diarization model (pyannote.audio 3.1, etc.)
- Scene detection model (YOLOv8, OpenCV version)
- Settings used (confidence thresholds, language, etc.)

**Stored in processing metadata:**
```json
{
  "processing_pipeline": {
    "ocr_engine": "Tesseract 5.3.0",
    "ocr_language": "eng",
    "ocr_settings": {"psm": 3, "oem": 1},
    "asr_model": "openai/whisper-large-v3",
    "asr_confidence_threshold": 0.85,
    "diarization_model": "pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1"
  }
}
```

### 3. Human Confirmation Required Flags

**AI-derived events are NEVER presented as established fact without review.**

All auto-detected items flagged:
- Scene detections: `"confidence": 0.91` (requires review if <0.95)
- Transcript segments: `"confidence_avg": 0.89` (flagged if <0.90)
- Entity extractions: `"confidence": 0.88` (review required)
- Near-duplicates: `"match_type": "Near_Duplicate"` (not "Exact")

**Review workflow:**
```json
{
  "scene_detection": {
    "scene_type": "HANDCUFFS_VISIBLE",
    "confidence": 0.88,
    "requires_human_confirmation": true,
    "confirmed_by": null,
    "confirmed_date": null
  }
}
```

### 4. Negative Evidence Preservation

**Most important feature for spoliation motions:**

When agency claims "no responsive records," the system:
1. Creates a `NegativeEvidence` record
2. Attaches the response letter/email (with SHA-256 hash)
3. Stores exact request scope and response text
4. Tracks responding custodian and agency
5. Logs request date and response date
6. Preserves in dedicated Excel sheet

**Use in motion practice:**
> "Defendant claims to have 'no responsive records' for CAD dispatch logs (Exhibit A, ACPO OPRA Response dated 12/15/2024, SHA-256: abc123...). However, discovery of radio logs (Exhibit B) references 'CAD Incident #25-001234' at 14:30:22 on the same date. This discrepancy suggests either incomplete search or spoliation."
