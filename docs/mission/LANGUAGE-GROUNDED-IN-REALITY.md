### 1. **templates/landing.html** - Homepage Hero

**BEFORE:**

```
Legal Research for Everyone
Professional-grade case law, citation analysis, and AI-powered research—
at 1/10th the cost of Westlaw and LexisNexis

Stats: 10M+ | 270 Years | 20x Cheaper
```

**AFTER:**

```
Affordable Legal Research for Solo Practitioners
Access 10M+ federal opinions with AI-powered analysis.
Built for legal aid, public defenders, and solo practice—at $50/month.

🚀 Early Beta: We're building affordable research tools by integrating
CourtListener's free legal data with AI assistance and mobile access.
The law itself is always free at CourtListener.com.

Stats: 10M+ (via CourtListener) | $50/mo (vs $500+ elsewhere) | AI+Mobile (coming Q1 2026)

- ✅ **Targeting underserved markets** (legal aid, solo, students)
- ✅ **Mission-driven** to democratize legal research

### What We're Actually Building:

- ✅ **Affordable access** to 10M+ federal opinions (via CourtListener)
- 🚧 **AI research assistant** (ChatGPT integration - Q1 2026)

- 🚧 **Judge research** (Bloomberg equivalent - Q1 2026)
- 🔜 **Mobile apps** (iOS/Android via MAUI - Q2 2026)

### What We're NOT:

- ❌ **NOT claiming superiority to Westlaw** (we're cheaper, more focused)
- ❌ **NOT hiding the free alternative** (CourtListener.com)
- ❌ **NOT making promises we can't keep** (beta disclaimers everywhere)

### Our Actual Value-Add:

1. **AI assistant** - ChatGPT integration for research queries

4. **Unified interface** - One app vs. multiple tools
5. **Affordable pricing** - $50/month vs. $500+ elsewhere

**We charge for convenience, AI, mobile, and support—NOT for legal data.**
