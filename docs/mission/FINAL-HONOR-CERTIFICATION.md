## 📝 WHAT DEVON CAN SAY WITH FULL HONOR

### **To Defense Attorneys:**

✅ "Evident gives you confidence in the evidence. Our AI searches BWC footage for Miranda warnings, potential 4th Amendment issues, and use-of-force incidents—flagging them for your review. You make the legal decisions. We just help you find what bad actors might bury."

### **To Good Officers:**

✅ "When you follow procedure, give Miranda warnings, and respect constitutional rights, the evidence proves it. Evident helps defense attorneys find the truth—which protects officers who do their job right and removes bad apples from the barrel."

### **To Civil Rights Organizations:**

✅ "We're pro-accountability, not anti-police. When bad actors violate the 4th Amendment or use excessive force, the evidence should expose it. When good officers follow the law, the evidence should protect them. That's how the system is supposed to work."

### **To Founding Members:**

✅ "First 100 members lock in $19/month for life. This is our promise: We'll never raise your rate, we'll provide all AI features as they're developed, we'll prioritize your support, and we'll listen to your feedback. This is our oath to you. By the Grace of Almighty God, we keep our word."
