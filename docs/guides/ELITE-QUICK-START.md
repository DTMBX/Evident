## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Get CourtListener API Key ✅
You already know this - add `COURTLISTENER_API_KEY` to Render as **SECRET**

### Step 2: Test Citation Analyzer (5 min)
```powershell
cd C:\web-dev\github-repos\BarberX.info

# Test Shepardizing a famous case
python -c "
from citation_network_analyzer import shepardize
import json
report = shepardize('410 U.S. 113')
print(json.dumps(report, indent=2))
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "case_info": {
    "title": "Roe v. Wade",
    "citation": "410 U.S. 113",
    "court": "Supreme Court",
    "year": "1973"
  },
  "signal": "yellow_flag",
  "good_law": false,
  "authority_score": 0.42,
  "recommendation": "⚠️ USE WITH CAUTION - Questioned by subsequent courts"
}
```

### Step 3: Test Judge Intelligence (5 min)
```powershell
python -c "
from judge_intelligence import JudgeIntelligence
ji = JudgeIntelligence()
profile = ji.get_judge_profile('Roberts')
print(f'Name: {profile[\"basic_info\"][\"name\"]}')
print(f'Education: {profile[\"education\"]}')
"
```

### Step 4: Import 1,000 Most-Cited Cases (30 min)
```python
# Create: import_top_cases.py

from citation_network_analyzer import CitationNetworkAnalyzer
from overnight_library_builder import OvernightLibraryBuilder

# Get 1,000 most-cited Supreme Court cases
# This creates critical mass for citation network

builder = OvernightLibraryBuilder()
builder.import_top_cited_cases(limit=1000, court='scotus')
```

### Step 5: Add API Endpoints (10 min)
```python
# In api/legal_library.py, add:

from citation_network_analyzer import shepardize
from judge_intelligence import JudgeIntelligence

@legal_library_bp.route('/shepardize', methods=['POST'])
def shepardize_case():
    """Shepardize a citation"""
    data = request.get_json()
    citation = data.get('citation')
    report = shepardize(citation)
    return jsonify(report)

@legal_library_bp.route('/judge/<name>', methods=['GET'])
def get_judge_profile(name):
    """Get judge intelligence profile"""
    ji = JudgeIntelligence()
    profile = ji.get_judge_profile(name)
    return jsonify(profile)
```
