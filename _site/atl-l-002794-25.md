  This Law Division civil action was closed gracefully by Hon. Sarah B. Johnson, J.S.C. on 2026-01-09. The Court advised Plaintiff that, once Plaintiff's post-conviction relief (PCR) is adjudicated, Plaintiff may refile the complaint against John W. Tumelty, Esq. and The Law Offices of John W. Tumelty. The matter originally arose from alleged attorney misconduct and failure to perform agreed legal services after acceptance of a retainer. Plaintiff asserted claims sounding in contract, fiduciary duty, statutory consumer fraud, fraud, negligence, unjust enrichment, and limited conviction-dependent malpractice. By court order, the matter was reassigned to Track 3 based on complexity and the presence of multiple independent claims.

# ATL-L-002794-25 – Barber v. Tumelty

## Case Overview

This Law Division action was closed on January 9, 2026, by Hon. Sarah B. Johnson, J.S.C., who advised Plaintiff **Devon Tyler Barber** that, once Plaintiff's post-conviction relief (PCR) is adjudicated, Plaintiff may refile the complaint against **John W. Tumelty, Esq.** and **The Law Offices of John W. Tumelty**. The case originally arose from Defendants’ alleged failure to perform agreed legal services after accepting a retainer in connection with Plaintiff’s pretrial detention and related criminal proceedings.

Plaintiff had alleged that Defendants abandoned representation, failed to communicate, failed to pursue available pretrial remedies, and retained fees without providing contracted services. The action asserted multiple independent causes of action sounding in contract, tort, and statute, rather than a single malpractice theory alone.

## Claims Asserted

Plaintiff’s operative pleadings asserted claims including, but not limited to:

- Breach of contract;
- Breach of fiduciary duty;
- Common-law fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation;
- Violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act;
- Negligence and professional misconduct;
- Unjust enrichment;
- Limited conviction-dependent legal malpractice (pled in the alternative and expressly preserved).
