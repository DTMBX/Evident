# 🔍 Reality Check - Language Fixes

## Issues Found & Fixes Applied

### ❌ PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:

1. **Claiming features we're building, not deployed**
   - "Shepardizing functional" → Not yet in production UI
   - "Judge intelligence operational" → Backend exists, no UI yet
   - "AI assistant integrated" → ChatGPT service exists, not user-facing

2. **Overstating current position**
   - "Dominant legal research platform" → We're PLANNING to be, not currently
   - "Industry recognition" → Aspirational, not current
   - "10M+ opinions live" → Can access via API, not ingested yet

3. **Misleading price comparisons**
   - Westlaw is $2,000/month for ENTERPRISE tier
   - Entry-level Westlaw is ~$500-800/month
   - Our comparison is technically true but cherry-picked

4. **Exaggerated timeline confidence**
   - "1,000 users in 90 days" → Aspirational goal, not guaranteed
   - "50 law school partnerships" → No outreach done yet
   - "Industry recognition" → Not within our control
