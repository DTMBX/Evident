  Subject: OPRA Request – Surety Bonds, Insurance, and Police Claims

Dear Records Custodian,

I, Devon Tyler of the Barber family, a private New Jerseyan, formally request access to public records under the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA), N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq.

Records Requested:
	1.	Surety Bond & Officer Bond Information
	•	Certified copies of all surety bonds and individual officer bonds for Galloway Township Police Department (GTPD) officers, including the Chief of Police and all sworn personnel.
	•	Documentation of the bonding company, underwriters, and policy terms indemnifying officers for misconduct, civil rights violations, or injuries under color of law.
	•	Records of any bond forfeitures, claims, or investigations against any GTPD officers from the past ten years.
	2.	Police Liability Insurance Policies
	•	Copies of all general liability, professional liability, and public official liability insurance policies covering GTPD officers.
	•	Coverage limits, exclusions, and claims processes for misconduct or injury claims.
	3.	Municipal Self-Insurance & Risk Management

	•	A record of all claims filed, paid, or settled involving misconduct, excessive force, or injuries caused by GTPD officers in the last ten years.

Format & Compliance:

I request these records in electronic format (PDF or digital copies) as required under OPRA. If any portion of this request is exempt, provide redacted copies rather than withholding entire documents.

Private Citizen Status & Fee Waiver:

This request is made in the public interest and for lawful due process. As I am not acting in a commercial capacity, I request a fee waiver as permitted under OPRA for non-commercial inquiries.

Please confirm receipt and provide an estimated fulfillment timeline per OPRA deadlines. If clarification is needed, contact me directly.

Best regards,
Devon Tyler of the Barber family.

  INTERNAL REVIEW REQUEST (WITH AMENDED OPRA)

Dear Galloway Township,

Please forward this submission to the official responsible for conducting Open Public Records Act (OPRA) internal reviews.

I respectfully request an internal review of Galloway Township’s handling of my OPRA request titled:

“Request for Public Records: Law Enforcement Officer Bond & Insurance Information.”

I. BASIS FOR INTERNAL REVIEW

My original OPRA request was submitted on March 11, 2025 and is now long overdue under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(i).

To date, the Township has issued no response of any kind, including:

no production of records,

no written denial citing statutory exemptions,

no request for clarification,

no statement of non-existence,

and no lawful extension of time.

A failure to respond within the statutory timeframe constitutes a constructive denial under OPRA and is itself a violation of the Act.

II. GOOD-FAITH CLARIFICATION AND AMENDMENT

In the interest of good faith, efficiency, and clarity—and to eliminate any possible confusion regarding custodianship or record categories—I hereby amend and clarify my OPRA request as part of this internal review.

This amended request supersedes and replaces the original request, while preserving the original filing date and record history.

III. AMENDED OPRA REQUEST (FOR REVIEW AND RESPONSE)
Custodian

Municipal Clerk of Galloway Township
(as custodian of municipal insurance, indemnification, and claims records)

Timeframe

January 1, 2022 – December 31, 2022

Records Requested
1. Municipal Insurance & Risk Coverage

Copies of all general liability, law-enforcement liability, professional liability, or public-official liability insurance policies in effect during calendar year 2022 that provided coverage for claims arising from Galloway Township police activity, including:

name of carrier or Joint Insurance Fund (JIF),

coverage limits,

relevant exclusions.

2. Indemnification & Defense Authority

All ordinances, resolutions, policies, or agreements governing:

indemnification of Galloway Township police officers for acts taken in the course of official duties;

defense obligations undertaken by the Township or its insurers.

3. Claims, Settlements & Payments (Aggregate / Administrative Only)

Records sufficient to show, in aggregate and by year, for calendar year 2022:

the number of claims asserted against Galloway Township arising from police conduct;

total settlement, judgment, or defense amounts paid or reserved using public funds.

This request does not seek:

internal-affairs files,

personnel evaluations,

disciplinary records,

or privileged attorney communications.

Format

Electronic format (PDF) is requested. If any portion is exempt, please provide redacted records rather than withholding entire documents, as required by OPRA.

IV. REQUEST FOR COMPLIANCE

This amended request seeks administrative and financial records only, squarely within OPRA’s disclosure mandate and routinely produced by municipalities statewide.

I respectfully request that Galloway Township:

Acknowledge this amended OPRA, and

Produce responsive records or issue a lawful written response within the time required by OPRA following this internal review.

V. RECORD OF PROCEEDINGS

A complete public record of the original OPRA request, its overdue status, and all correspondence is available at:

  Hello Ms. Danieli,

Thank you again for providing the records responsive to OPRA Request No. OPRA-2025-00206.

Upon review, I need to clarify an apparent discrepancy between the Redaction Index and the nature of the redacted record.

The redacted page appears to be a claims history / insurance loss run reflecting allegations such as police misconduct and excessive force arising from actions of hired public employees acting in their official capacity. The document does not appear to concern juvenile records or minors.

However, the Redaction Index cites “names of minors” under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 as the basis for redaction.

To ensure the response is complete and reviewable, please clarify:

Whether any of the redacted names on that claims sheet are, in fact, minors;

If not, the specific statutory or rule-based authority relied upon to redact names associated with adult claims involving official police conduct; and

Whether a corrected Redaction Index or unredacted version of the claims sheet can be provided consistent with OPRA.

This request is made solely to understand the basis for the redactions applied and to ensure the OPRA response accurately reflects the records produced.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Respectfully,
/s/ Devon Tyler Barber
Atlantic County, New Jersey
