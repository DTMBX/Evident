## Email #1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: AI-Powered BWC Analysis for [State Bar]
Members

**To:** [Bar Association Executive Director / CLE Coordinator]

**Body:**

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out from Evident Legal Technologies with a partnership proposal
that could benefit [State Bar Association]'s criminal defense and civil rights
attorney members.

**Who We Are:**

Evident is an AI-powered platform that automates the analysis of body-worn
camera (BWC) footage for criminal defense cases. We help attorneys reduce BWC
analysis time by 85% (from 20 hours to 2 hours per case) through automated
transcription, timeline reconstruction, and discrepancy detection.

**The Challenge Your Members Face:**

With 72% of police departments now using BWCs, defense attorneys are drowning in
video evidence: • Average case: 8-12 hours of footage to review • Manual
analysis: 15-20 hours per hour of footage • Public defenders: 100+ cases
simultaneously • Result: Critical 3-second discrepancies are missed → clients
wrongly convicted

**Partnership Proposal:**

We'd like to offer [State Bar] members:

1. **Exclusive 15% Discount** on all Evident subscription plans
   - PROFESSIONAL: $49 → $41.65/month
   - PREMIUM: $199 → $169.15/month
   - ENTERPRISE: $499 → $424.15/month

2. **Co-Branded CLE Webinar** (1.5 credits)
   - Title: "BWC Analysis Best Practices for Defense Attorneys"
   - Format: 90-minute Zoom webinar + Q&A
   - Content: Legal standards, analysis framework, live demo
   - Accreditation: We'll apply for [State] Bar CLE approval

3. **Revenue Share for the Association**
   - 10% recurring commission on member subscriptions
   - Example: 50 members subscribe (avg $99/month) = $495/month revenue for
     [State Bar]

**What We're Asking:**

1. Announce the partnership to members (email newsletter, website)
2. Co-host the CLE webinar (we handle content, you promote)
3. Provide a referral link for members to sign up

**Zero Financial Risk:**

This is a revenue-generating partnership for [State Bar]. No upfront costs, no
commitments—just value for your members and recurring revenue for the
association.

**Next Steps:**

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to discuss this partnership?

I'm available: • [Date/Time Option 1] • [Date/Time Option 2] • [Date/Time Option
3]

Or feel free to suggest a time: [Insert Calendly link]

I've attached a one-page partnership deck with more details. Happy to answer any
questions.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to empower your members with
cutting-edge legal technology.

Best regards,

## Email #2: Follow-Up (7 Days Later)

**Subject:** Re: Partnership Opportunity - Quick Question

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my partnership proposal from last week.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short:

**Quick Question:** Would your members benefit from a tool that reduces BWC
analysis time from 20 hours to 2 hours per case?

If yes, I'd love to discuss how Evident can:

1. Save your members time (85% faster analysis)
2. Generate revenue for [State Bar] (10% commission on subscriptions)
3. Provide valuable CLE content (1.5 credits on BWC analysis)

**No pressure—just checking if this is worth 15 minutes of your time.**

Available this week: • [Time slots]

Or let me know if this isn't a fit, and I'll stop bothering you. 😊

Best,

Devon

## Email #3: Value-Add Follow-Up (14 Days Later)

**Subject:** Free Resource: BWC Analysis Checklist for [State Bar] Members

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Even if the partnership isn't the right fit right now, I wanted to share
something useful for your members.

I've created a **free BWC Analysis Checklist (PDF)** that defense attorneys can
use to systematically review body camera footage:

✓ 7-step analysis framework  
✓ Legal standards for admissibility  
✓ Common discrepancies to look for  
✓ Cross-examination techniques

**No strings attached**—just a resource your members might find helpful.

Download here: [Link to free checklist]

If you'd like to feature this in your newsletter or resource library, feel free
to share it with members.

And if you ever want to revisit the partnership conversation, I'm here.

Thanks for all you do for the defense bar.

Best,

**Devon Tyler Barber**

## Email #4: Case Study Share (30 Days Later)

**Subject:** Case Study: How BWC Analysis Won a "Unwinnable" Case

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I wanted to share a success story that might interest your members.

**The Case:** Client charged with felony assault on police officer

**The Challenge:** Prosecutor had 3 officer testimonies + 8 hours of BWC footage

**The Outcome:** Charges dismissed after Evident analysis found a 3-second
discrepancy proving the officer's injury was self-inflicted, not caused by the
defendant.

**Time saved:** Attorney spent 12 hours with Evident vs. 160+ hours manual
review.

Full case study (anonymized): [Link]

This is exactly the kind of outcome your members could achieve with the right
tools.

Still interested in exploring a partnership? Let me know.

Best,

Devon

## Email #5: Final Outreach (60 Days Later)

**Subject:** Checking In One Last Time

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I've reached out a few times about a partnership between Evident and [State
Bar], but haven't heard back.

I totally understand if it's not a priority right now—you're juggling a lot.

**Before I close the loop, two quick questions:**

1. Is this something you'd consider in the future (maybe Q3 or Q4 2026)?
2. Is there someone else at [State Bar] I should connect with (e.g., CLE
   committee, technology committee)?

If it's a hard pass, no worries—I'll stop reaching out. Just want to make sure
I'm not pestering the wrong person. 😊

Thanks for your time,

**Devon Tyler Barber**
