    annual_scripts_millions: 122
    profit_driver: "Volume bonuses + satisfaction scores rewarded chronic refills even when evidence only supports short-term trauma care."

    nature_lineage: "Morphinan alkaloids were isolated from the opium poppy; whole-plant allies such as turmeric, ginger, and rosemary supply anti-inflammatory relief without respiratory depression."

lineage:
  - drug: "Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)"
    origin: "Salicin in white willow (Salix alba) inspired the synthetic."
    takeaway: "Whole-bark teas deliver the same salicylates with tannins that buffer the stomach."
  - drug: "Morphine / Oxycodone"
    origin: "Isolated from opium poppy latex before being acetylated and patented."
    takeaway: "Plants like turmeric, ginger, and rosemary calm the same inflammatory cascades without respiratory suppression."
  - drug: "Metformin"
    origin: "Galegine alkaloids in French lilac (Galega officinalis) informed biguanides."
    takeaway: "Fiber- and bitter-rich greens lower glucose swings alongside clinical care."
  - drug: "Digoxin"
    origin: "Digitoxin glycosides concentrated from foxglove flowers."
    takeaway: "Plants demand respect—dosage discipline is sacred whether the molecule is in a lab or a leaf."
  - drug: "Paclitaxel"
    origin: "Harvested first from the Pacific yew tree (Taxus brevifolia)."
    takeaway: "Regenerative forestry, not patent games, keeps life-saving compounds available."
