      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We design interfaces that connect government and citizens with clarity, respect, and accountability. Like a thoughtful hotelier, we anticipate needs, remove friction, and preserve dignity.</p>

      <h3>Principles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> Interfaces that everyone can use, regardless of ability.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Clear paths, audit trails, and explainable interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountable:</strong> Evidence-preserving workflows that respect due process.</li>
        <li><strong>Human-centered:</strong> Designed for real people with real needs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How Evident Helps</h3>
      <p>We build secure, auditable systems for evidence management, custody, and compliance that make it simple for agencies and citizens to process information reliably and fairly.</p>

      <h3>Get Involved</h3>
