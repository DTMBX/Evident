PRODUCTION ERROR FIXED:
- Changed founding_member_signup() from raw SQL (get_db) to CSV flat file
- get_db() doesn't exist in Flask-SQLAlchemy setup
- CSV approach is simpler, production-ready for email capture
- Avoids database schema changes on production deploy

ERROR WAS:
AttributeError at line 2675: get_db() not defined
Raw SQL cursor.execute() incompatible with Flask-SQLAlchemy

FIX:
- Use founding_member_signups.csv for email capture
- Check for duplicates before adding
- Count spots remaining (100 max)
- Same API response structure
- Production: Integrate with Stripe customer creation later

TESTED: CSV file creation, duplicate detection, spots counting
SAFE: No database migrations required
SIMPLE: Easy to review signups (open CSV)

This unblocks Day 1 deployment."
