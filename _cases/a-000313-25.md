## Case Overview

This case record maintains a factual, chronological archive for **A-000313-25**, an Appellate Division matter arising from an encounter in Atlantic County involving an alleged jaywalking violation and subsequent law enforcement actions.

According to the appellant’s account, the incident began when the appellant was stopped as a pedestrian by Officer Boyd of the Township of Hamilton Police Department, who allegedly assumed the appellant had crossed directly from a neighborhood across the street, resulting in claims of bias and profiling. The appellant asserts being harassed for identification, driver’s license, and Social Security number, and after refusing to provide private information—following Officer Boyd’s assurance that no ticket would be issued—invoked constitutional and New Jersey rights. The encounter escalated, resulting in the appellant being tackled, arrested, and charged in Superior Court with hindering an investigation, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest. The appellant states that a plea was entered to a disorderly persons offense in Superior Court to resolve the matter expediently.

## Notes

- **Origin linkage:** This appeal is understood to arise from a street-crossing conviction in Atlantic County. If the originating docket number(s) are not confirmed by an appellate order, municipal judgment, or stamped filing, do not state them as fact—add them only once verified.
- **Folder consolidation:** Prior duplicate folders were removed to maintain a single source of truth and prevent conflicting summaries.
