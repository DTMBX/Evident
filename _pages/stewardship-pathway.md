# The Stewardship Pathway

**From witness to participant. From participant to steward.**

Faith Frontier invites you into a **journey of transformation**—where transparency teaches trust, where cases become classrooms, and where land stewardship becomes life stewardship.

---

## The Four Levels

### Level 1: Observer — See the Work
**Current location: You are here**

Browse freely. See how Faith Frontier operates:

- **[Case Records](/cases/)** - Court filings showing procedural competence and constitutional literacy
- **[Manifesto](/manifesto/)** - Public commitments to truth, equity, and faith
- **[Ministry Charter](/essays/ministry-charter/)** - Organizational structure and governance
- **[Property Scout System](/scout/)** - Transparent land acquisition process

**What you learn:**  
This is what accountability looks like. Every decision documented. Every case public. Every commitment measurable.

**Time commitment:** Browse at your own pace  
**Next step:** When you're ready to learn more → [Proceed to Level 2](#level-2)

### Level 2: Learner — Understand the Principles {#level-2}

Faith Frontier's work rests on three foundations:

#### 1. Constitution & Conscience
**Cases as Teaching Tools**

Our legal battles aren't just about winning—they're about *revealing*:

- How **due process** protects the powerless
- How **constitutional rights** apply to everyday people
- How **procedure** is mercy when followed, tyranny when ignored

**Study path:**
- Read [Revelations](/essays/revelations/) - principles woven through our cases
- Explore individual case narratives
- See how law and faith intersect

#### 2. Land & Law
**Property Stewardship Principles**

Land isn't just real estate—it's **sacred trust**:

- Stewardship over exploitation
- Community benefit over private gain
- Transparent acquisition and use
- Environmental and social responsibility

**Study path:**
- Review [How We Discern Properties](/scout/how-we-discern-properties/)
- Understand the scoring criteria
- See the separation between Faith Frontier Trust (acquisition) and Tillerstead LLC (construction)

#### 3. Faith & Practice
**Theological Foundation**

Our faith isn't private—it's **public witness**:

- Worship through work (tilling and keeping)
- Justice as love made visible
- Community as covenant
- Sabbath as resistance to exploitation

**Study path:**
- Read [Tiller Earth](/essays/tiller-earth/) - theological framework
- Explore [Geneva Law Integration](/essays/geneva-law-integration/)
- Consider [Constitution as Covenant](/essays/constitution-as-covenant/)

**Assessment:**

#### Steward Covenant

Becoming a steward requires:

1. **Complete Levels 1-3** with demonstrated understanding
2. **Background check** and reference verification
3. **Probationary period** (90 days minimum)
4. **Formal commitment** to Faith Frontier's values and practices
5. **Ongoing accountability** through regular meetings and reporting

**Stewards receive:**
