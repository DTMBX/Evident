OPINIONS

Based on my review, I hold the following opinions to a reasonable degree of professional certainty:

OPINION #1: THE INITIAL DETENTION WAS UNLAWFUL

The officers lacked reasonable suspicion or probable cause to detain Mr. Devon Barber.

ANALYSIS:
    • Under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), officers must have reasonable, articulable 
      suspicion based on specific facts to conduct an investigatory stop.
    
    • Review of body-worn camera footage reveals no lawful justification for the stop.
    
    • The officers failed to articulate any specific criminal activity.
    
    • The stop appears to have been pretextual or based on mere suspicion.

OPINION #2: THE USE OF FORCE WAS OBJECTIVELY UNREASONABLE

The force used against Mr. Devon Barber violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition 
on excessive force under Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989).

GRAHAM V. CONNOR ANALYSIS:

Factor 1: Severity of Crime
    • The alleged offense (if any) was minor
    • No violent crime or felony alleged
    • At most, a traffic violation or misdemeanor
    CONCLUSION: This factor weighs AGAINST use of force

Factor 2: Immediate Threat
    • BWC footage shows Mr. Devon Barber posed no threat
    • He was unarmed
    • He made no threatening gestures
    • He verbally questioned officers but did not threaten them
    CONCLUSION: This factor weighs AGAINST use of force

Factor 3: Active Resistance
    • Mr. Devon Barber questioned the stop but did not physically resist
    • Verbal objection ≠ active resistance (see Goodwin v. City of Painesville)
    • BWC audio clearly captures Mr. Devon Barber saying "I can't breathe"
    • Continuing force after subject is restrained violates Graham
    CONCLUSION: This factor weighs AGAINST use of force

Factor 4: Attempting to Evade
    • No evidence Mr. Devon Barber attempted to flee
    • He remained at the scene throughout
    CONCLUSION: This factor weighs AGAINST use of force

OVERALL GRAHAM ANALYSIS:
All four Graham factors weigh AGAINST the use of force. The officers' conduct was 
objectively unreasonable and violated clearly established law.

OPINION #3: THE FORCE EXCEEDED DEPARTMENT POLICY

Even if the initial detention were lawful (which it was not), the force used exceeded 
the department's own policies on use of force continuum.

POLICY VIOLATIONS:
    • Officers failed to use verbal de-escalation before physical force
    • Force continued after subject was compliant
    • Officers ignored subject's complaints of pain and breathing difficulty
    • No supervisor was called to the scene
    • Incident was not properly documented in use of force reports

OPINION #4: OFFICERS FAILED TO PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE

The officers' failure to summon medical assistance despite obvious injuries and complaints 
of pain constitutes deliberate indifference under the Fourteenth Amendment.

EVIDENCE:
    • BWC audio: Mr. Devon Barber repeatedly said "I can't breathe" and "You're hurting me"
    • Visible injuries evident in footage
    • No ambulance was called
    • Officers ignored medical needs for [duration]
    • Delay in medical care exacerbated injuries

OPINION #5: MUNICIPALITY FAILED TO ADEQUATELY TRAIN

The constitutional violations were foreseeable and resulted from inadequate training.

TRAINING DEFICIENCIES:
    • No meaningful training on de-escalation
    • Insufficient training on constitutional limitations
    • Failure to train on recognizing medical emergencies
    • No training on duty to intervene when fellow officers use excessive force
    • Pattern of similar incidents indicates systemic failure

OPINION #6: COMPARABLE INCIDENTS

This incident follows a pattern of excessive force by this department. I am aware of 
[number] similar incidents involving:
    • Unlawful stops without reasonable suspicion
    • Excessive force during routine encounters
    • Failure to provide medical care
    • False charges to justify unlawful detention

CONCLUSION

The officers' conduct in this case represents a clear violation of constitutional standards, 
professional norms, and department policy. The use of force was objectively unreasonable, 
unnecessary, and unlawful.

Mr. Devon Barber's rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments were violated, 
and the municipality bears responsibility for failing to train, supervise, and discipline 
its officers.
