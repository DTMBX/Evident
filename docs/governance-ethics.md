## Core Commitments

- **Truthful record:** discourage selective editing and misleading presentation.
- **Non-escalation:** recording must never be used to provoke conflict.
- **Dignity:** avoid humiliation, harassment, or public shaming.
- **Minimum necessary:** collect and retain as little as possible.
- **Accountability:** publish standards, document decisions, and correct
  mistakes.
- **Due process:** support fair outcomes; do not substitute for lawful
  procedures.

## Prohibited Uses

- Covert surveillance or stalking
- Harassment, intimidation, or targeted humiliation
- Monetizing or trading sensitive recordings
- “Doxxing” or publishing private data
- Incitement, vigilantism, or interference with emergencies

## Safety First

If recording increases immediate risk, de-escalation and safety come first.

## Status

This document is a draft. Implementation details will be released after
validation and review.
