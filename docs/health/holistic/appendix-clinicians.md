# Clinician Collaboration Appendix

**A medically cautious, patient-responsibility framework**

This appendix exists to support collaboration with licensed clinicians. It does not replace clinical judgment.

## Principles

- Medication can be lifesaving. The objective is not “anti-medicine.”
- The objective is **risk reduction**, **informed consent**, and **functional improvement**.
- Holistic interventions here are designed to be low-risk, food-first, and scalable.

## What this project is

- A structured, zone-aware repository of food-first practices, herbs, and topical supports
- A way for patients to improve consistency (nutrition, movement, sleep), which often improves outcomes

## What this project is not

- Not a directive to deprescribe
- Not a replacement for evidence-based diagnosis or treatment
- Not a substitute for monitoring, labs, or clinical follow-up

## Safety guardrails (recommended)

- Medication changes only under clinician supervision
- Document baseline symptoms and functional status
- Start interventions one at a time to reduce confounding
- Avoid high-dose extracts; prioritize whole-food and topical approaches
- Screen for interactions (examples):
  - St. John’s Wort: multi-drug interactions
  - Concentrated essential oils: skin sensitization risk
  - Anticoagulants: caution with certain supplements (verify individually)

## Collaboration workflow (suggested)

1. Patient identifies goal: pain, sleep, stress, inflammation
2. Clinician screens red flags and contraindications
3. Patient implements low-risk routine for 2–4 weeks
4. Reassess: function, sleep, pain score, side effects, adherence
5. Only then consider medication optimization

## Faith Frontier stance

We support informed consent, accountability, and stewardship of health as a moral responsibility.
We do not attribute illness to moral failure, nor do we replace clinical care with ideology.
