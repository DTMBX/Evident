**Defendants:** City of Trenton; Officer John Doe 1; Officer John Doe 2  
**Case Type:** Civil Action – Verified Complaint & Order to Show Cause (Emergency Injunctive Relief)  
**Primary Relief Sought:** Immediate return of unlawfully impounded vehicle; declaratory and equitable relief

### Nature of the Action

This is an **emergent civil action** seeking immediate injunctive and equitable relief under **R. 4:52-1** and **R. 4:67-1**. Plaintiff challenges the seizure and continued retention of his **2019 Volkswagen Passat (NJ Plate F35VLP)**, which was taken and held without statutory authority, court order, forfeiture process, or constitutionally adequate due process.

### Core Facts

- On **December 7, 2025**, Trenton police officers seized Plaintiff's vehicle following a traffic stop and custodial arrest.
- The arrest resulted in municipal-level charges, **none of which authorize vehicle impoundment** under Title 39 or any forfeiture statute.
- The vehicle was **operable, legally parked, not contraband, not evidence, and posed no public-safety hazard** at the time of seizure.
- **No forfeiture complaint, warrant, inventory, or judicial order** has ever been issued authorizing continued retention of the vehicle.
- Defendants have refused to release the vehicle unless towing and storage fees are paid, despite the impoundment being **unlawful ab initio**.

These facts are set forth in sworn certifications and a verified complaint filed with the Court.
