# ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN (example)

DO NOT store real tokens in the repository.

This file explains how to create and add an `ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN` repository secret used by the `branch-protection.yml` workflow.

1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT):
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic) or fine-grained tokens.
   - The token must have `repo` (full control of private repositories) or equivalent admin scopes for this repository.

2. Add the secret to the repository:
   - Go to the repository → Settings → Secrets & variables → Actions → New repository secret.
   - Name: `ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN`
   - Value: paste the PAT you created.

3. Usage (the workflow reads `secrets.ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN`):
   - The `branch-protection.yml` workflow uses this secret to call the GitHub API and apply branch protection settings.

Local testing: export the token into your shell (never commit):

  Windows PowerShell:
    $env:ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN = 'ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'

  macOS / Linux:
    export ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Remove the token from your environment after testing.
