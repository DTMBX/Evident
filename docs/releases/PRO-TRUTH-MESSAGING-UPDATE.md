# DAY 1 FINAL: Pro-Truth Messaging Added

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE — Landing Page Now Honors Both Sides**

--

## 🛡️ What Changed (Pro-Truth Update)

Devon requested messaging that shows:

1. **We sell confidence, not conflict**
2. **Truth protects good officers too**
3. **Not anti-police — we're pro-accountability**
4. **Removing bad apples protects the good ones**
5. **Mutual oath: Both sides serve justice**

--

## ✅ New Section Added: "Truth Protects Good Officers, Too"

### **Core Message:**

> "We're not anti-police. **We're pro-truth.** Evident helps dig up the facts that bad actors bury—protecting innocent defendants _and_ the good officers who serve with honor."

### **Three-Part Framework:**

#### ✓ **For Good Officers**

When you follow procedure, give Miranda warnings, and respect constitutional rights—**the evidence proves it.** Truth protects officers who do their job right.

#### ✗ **For Bad Actors**

When someone violates the 4th Amendment, lies in reports, or uses excessive force—**the evidence exposes it.** Truth removes bad apples from the barrel.

#### ⚖️ **Mutual Oath**

Peace officers swear to _protect and serve._ Defense attorneys swear to _defend the Constitution._ Both oaths demand truth. We help you honor yours.
