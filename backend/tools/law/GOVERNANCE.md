Law module governance

This file documents governance rules for the `backend/tools/law` ingestion pipeline.

Rules (normative)
- Immutable capture: RAW captures of source content MUST be stored as immutable blobs under `backend/tools/law/blobs/raw/` named by SHA-256. Implementations MUST NOT overwrite existing raw blobs; they SHALL be append-only.
- Deterministic canonicalization: Canonical bytes SHALL be produced by deterministic routines (stable newline, whitespace normalization, and a deterministic HTML->text extraction). Implementations MUST produce identical canonical bytes for identical inputs.
- Append-only provenance: All processing steps MUST append provenance events to an append-only store (SQLite `provenance_events`) recording tool versions, inputs_sha256, outputs_sha256, and timestamp_utc. Implementations MUST avoid deleting provenance events for ordinary ingest operations.
- CI enforcement: The repository CI SHALL run the offline-safe law test lane (Lane A) on pull requests and pushes. Lane A MUST NOT require repository secrets and MUST be safe for forked PRs. Privileged operations that require secrets (Lane B) SHALL be gated to runs on `main` or manual dispatch and SHALL check presence of required secrets before executing networked actions.

Operational notes
- Developers should run unit tests locally using the pinned dev requirements: `pip install -r backend/tools/law/requirements-dev.txt` then `python -m pytest backend/tests -q`.
- SBOMs are generated by CI and preserved as artifacts; canonical manifests and blobs are the source-of-truth for audit.
