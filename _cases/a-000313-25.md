## Case Overview

This case record maintains a factual, chronological archive for **A-000313-25**, an Appellate Division matter arising from an encounter in Atlantic County involving an alleged jaywalking violation and subsequent law enforcement actions.

According to the appellant's account, the incident began when the appellant was stopped as a pedestrian by Officer Boyd of the Township of Hamilton Police Department, who allegedly assumed the appellant had crossed directly from a neighborhood across the street, resulting in claims of bias and profiling. The appellant asserts being harassed for identification, driver's license, and Social Security number, and after refusing to provide private information—following Officer Boyd's assurance that no ticket would be issued—invoked constitutional and New Jersey rights. The encounter escalated, resulting in the appellant being tackled, arrested, and charged in Superior Court with hindering an investigation, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest. The appellant states that a plea was entered to a disorderly persons offense in Superior Court to resolve the matter expediently.

Faith Frontier maintains this page to (1) preserve a coherent timeline, (2) centralize filings and orders for public inspection, and (3) reduce ambiguity created by fragmented or duplicated folders. This page is not a substitute for the official court docket; it is an indexed reference layer that points back to primary-source documents.

### Scope and Integrity Rules (Faith Frontier Standard)

- **Primary sources control.** Where a summary conflicts with an order, notice, filing stamp, or docket entry, the primary source controls and the summary must be corrected.
- **No assumptions.** If a fact (date, caption, originating docket, disposition) is not confirmed by a document, it is described as unconfirmed and left neutral.
- **Neutral tone.** This archive preserves claims and positions as asserted, while labeling them as assertions unless adjudicated.
