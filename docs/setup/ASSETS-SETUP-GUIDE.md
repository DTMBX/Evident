    <div class="container">
        <h1>Body-Worn Camera Analysis Best Practices</h1>
        
        <h2>1. Identifying Critical Timestamps</h2>
        <p>Look for key moments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initial contact</li>
            <li>Rights advisement</li>
            <li>Use of force</li>

            <li>Officer tone and demeanor</li>
            <li>Subject responses</li>
            <li>Background conversations</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Fourth Amendment Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Was there probable cause?</li>
            <li>Was consent voluntary?</li>
            <li>Were Miranda rights given?</li>
        </ul>
