⚠️ CRITICAL FFMPEG GPL LICENSE ISSUE

FFmpeg Build Configuration Detected:
--enable-gpl --enable-version3

This means the installed FFmpeg is GPL-licensed, NOT LGPL.

ISSUE:
GPL (General Public License) has "copyleft" requirements:
- Any software that links to GPL libraries must also be GPL
- Proprietary software CANNOT use GPL libraries without releasing source code
- This conflicts with BarberX's proprietary license

SOLUTIONS:

Option 1: USE LGPL BUILD (RECOMMENDED)
- Download LGPL FFmpeg build (without --enable-gpl flag)
- LGPL allows dynamic linking in proprietary software
- No source code disclosure required
- Download from: https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases
  Look for: ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-lgpl.zip

Option 2: COMPLY WITH GPL
- Release BarberX source code under GPL license
- Allow anyone to use, modify, and redistribute
- Not compatible with current proprietary licensing

Option 3: REMOVE FFMPEG DEPENDENCY
- Use alternative libraries (moviepy with LGPL backend, or native Python)
- More limited functionality
- No GPL conflicts

CURRENT STATUS:
⚠️ Using GPL FFmpeg with proprietary software = LICENSE VIOLATION
⚠️ Must resolve before production deployment

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Download LGPL FFmpeg build
2. Replace current FFmpeg installation
3. Verify with: ffmpeg -version (should NOT show --enable-gpl)
4. Update THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md to reflect LGPL version

LEGAL RISK:
- GPL violation could result in copyright infringement claims
- Must provide source code OR switch to LGPL build
- Priority: HIGH (blocks production launch)
