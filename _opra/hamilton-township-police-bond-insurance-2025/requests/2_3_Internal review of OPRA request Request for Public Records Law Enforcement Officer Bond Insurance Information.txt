INTERNAL REVIEW REQUEST (WITH AMENDED OPRA)
Hamilton Township / Hamilton Township Police Department

Dear Hamilton Township,

Please forward this submission to the official responsible for conducting Open Public Records Act (OPRA) internal reviews, including the Municipal Clerk or other designated OPRA review authority.

I respectfully request an internal review of Hamilton Township’s handling of my OPRA request titled:

“OPRA Request – Surety Bonds, Insurance, and Police Claims.”

────────────────────────────

I. BASIS FOR INTERNAL REVIEW

My original OPRA request was submitted on March 11, 2025 and is now long overdue under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(i).

To date, Hamilton Township and/or the Hamilton Township Police Department has issued no response of any kind, including:

no production of records

no written denial citing statutory exemptions

no request for clarification

no statement that responsive records do not exist

no lawful extension of time

A failure to respond within the statutory timeframe constitutes a constructive denial under OPRA and is itself a violation of the Act.

────────────────────────────

II. GOOD-FAITH CLARIFICATION AND AMENDMENT

To ensure clarity, efficiency, and good faith—and to eliminate any possible confusion regarding custodianship or record categories—I hereby amend and clarify my OPRA request as part of this internal review.

This amended OPRA request supersedes and replaces the original request, while preserving the original filing date, overdue status, and record history.

────────────────────────────

III. AMENDED OPRA REQUEST (FOR REVIEW AND RESPONSE)

CUSTODIAN

Municipal Clerk of Hamilton Township
(as custodian of municipal insurance, indemnification, and claims records)

TIMEFRAME

January 1, 2024 – Present

CONTEXT (FOR IDENTIFICATION ONLY)

This request relates to municipal risk, insurance, and indemnification records associated with police activity during 2024 and 2025, including matters involving Officer Stephen Boyd (2024) and Officer Ruiz (2025).

This context is provided solely to identify relevant records and does not seek internal-affairs or personnel materials.

────────────────────────────

RECORDS REQUESTED

MUNICIPAL INSURANCE AND RISK COVERAGE

Copies of all general liability, law-enforcement liability, professional liability, or public-official liability insurance policies in effect during 2024–2025 that provided coverage for claims arising from Hamilton Township police activity, including:

name of carrier or Joint Insurance Fund (JIF)

coverage limits

relevant exclusions

INDEMNIFICATION AND DEFENSE AUTHORITY

All ordinances, resolutions, policies, or agreements governing:

indemnification of Hamilton Township police officers for acts taken in the course of official duties

defense obligations undertaken by the Township, insurer, or JIF

CLAIMS, SETTLEMENTS, AND PAYMENTS
(AGGREGATE / ADMINISTRATIVE ONLY)

Records sufficient to show, in aggregate and by year, for 2024 and 2025:

the number of claims asserted against Hamilton Township arising from police conduct

total settlement, judgment, or defense amounts paid or reserved using public funds

This request does not seek:

internal-affairs investigations

disciplinary records

personnel evaluations

privileged attorney-client communications

────────────────────────────

FORMAT

Electronic format (PDF) is requested.
If any portion of a responsive record is exempt, please provide redacted records rather than withholding entire documents, as required by OPRA.

────────────────────────────

IV. REQUEST FOR COMPLIANCE

This amended request seeks routine administrative and financial records squarely within OPRA’s disclosure mandate and commonly produced by New Jersey municipalities.

I respectfully request that Hamilton Township:

Acknowledge this amended OPRA; and

Produce responsive records or issue a lawful written response within the time required by OPRA following this internal review.

────────────────────────────

V. RECORD OF PROCEEDINGS
