  NEW JERSEY OPEN PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST

Automated Toll Enforcement, Vendor Ownership, Data Security, and Due-Process Records

Dear OPRA Custodian,

Please accept this electronic request for public records pursuant to the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA), N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq., and the common-law right of access.

Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-6(f), this email constitutes a valid OPRA request. No agency-specific form or software platform is required.

This request is made:
	•	for public-interest and informational purposes only,
	•	not for any commercial use, and
	•	not to interfere with any pending legal proceeding.

STATEMENT OF PUBLIC INTEREST

New Jersey has expanded camera-based tolling, automated enforcement, and third-party processing, accompanied by escalating administrative fees and penalty schedules.

Public oversight is required where the State:
	•	delegates toll enforcement and data processing to private vendors,
	•	collects and retains motorists’ travel and identity data,
	•	imposes penalties far exceeding underlying toll amounts, and
	•	relies on automated systems for notice, billing, and enforcement.

This request seeks records necessary for residents to understand how these systems operate, who controls them, how vendors are compensated, and what safeguards exist for data security and due process.

RECORDS CUSTODIAN & CONTROL

If responsive records are created, received, relied upon, or controlled by the agency, they are subject to OPRA regardless of whether a contractor or vendor physically maintains them.

If you are not the proper custodian for any portion, please forward this request and identify the appropriate custodian.
