# Evident Technologies  
## About the Technology – Statement of Technical Function

I submit the following description for the purpose of explaining, in plain technical terms, how the Evident Technologies platform functions.

---

## 1. Nature of the System

Evident is a software system designed to assist users in organizing, processing, and verifying digital evidence. The platform performs technical operations only and does not render legal conclusions or factual determinations.

---

## 2. Evidence Processing

The system allows users to upload digital files, which may include video, audio, images, documents, or structured data. Upon ingestion, the system applies technical processes such as:

- File hashing for integrity verification
- Metadata normalization
- Time-based organization
- Audit logging of system actions

Original files are not altered.

---

## 3. Integrity and Verification

Evident generates cryptographic hashes and audit records to support detection of alteration or corruption. These mechanisms are designed to assist users in demonstrating consistency of files over time.

The system does not certify authenticity, truthfulness, or admissibility.

---

## 4. Analytical Assistance

Where enabled, the platform may execute third-party analytical tools or models locally to assist with tasks such as transcription or text extraction. These tools generate outputs based on technical processing, not factual adjudication.

---

## 5. Human Control

All uploads, exports, interpretations, and uses of outputs are initiated and controlled by the user. The system does not operate autonomously and does not replace professional judgment.

---

## 6. Limitations

Evident does not:
- Determine legal relevance
- Determine credibility
- Guarantee admissibility
- Provide legal advice

The platform functions solely as a technical processing tool.

I declare that the above description is accurate to the best of my knowledge and is provided for explanatory purposes only.
