    <h2>The Project: Four Documents</h2>

    <div class="grid-2">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>1. USA Medication Statistics by State</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Data-driven proof of the problem.</strong>
          Which states have the highest prescription rates? What medications? Why?
        </p>
        <p>
          We document:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>National Rx rates by class (antidepressants, opioids, antacids, statins)</li>
          <li>State-by-state breakdown (72% in Florida; 71% in West Virginia)</li>
          <li>Root causes (poverty, food deserts, opioid mills, industrial decline)</li>
          <li>Overmedication patterns (polypharmacy, drug-drug interactions)</li>
          <li>USDA zones paired with each state (for plant-based alternatives)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> Show this is not opinion—it's documented reality that demands response.

        <h3>2. Gardening as Healing: The Rubric</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>The natural cure for chronic disease.</strong>
          How does gardening address the six root causes of inflammation, pain, depression, and metabolic disease?
        </p>
        <p>
          We provide:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A framework linking gardening to six healing systems</li>
          <li>Practical rubric: condition → root cause → pharmaceutical → gardening solution → timeline</li>
          <li>Evidence from soil science, nutrition, neurobiology, circadian rhythms</li>
          <li>Why gardening is the only intervention that addresses all six systems simultaneously</li>
          <li>Zone-by-zone implementation (zones 3–11)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> Demonstrate that stewardship—not pills—is the fundamental healing practice.

    <h2>The Evidence: Why This Works</h2>

    <h3>Six healing systems</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Home-grown vegetables have 2–3x higher micronutrient density (USDA 2020)</li>
      <li><strong>Movement:</strong> 3 hours/week gardening = 150 min moderate exercise (CDC guidelines)</li>
      <li><strong>Stress reduction:</strong> Soil bacteria (Mycobacterium vaccae) trigger serotonin via vagus nerve</li>
      <li><strong>Sleep quality:</strong> Outdoor light (2,000–10,000 lux) is 100x stronger than indoor; sets circadian rhythm</li>
      <li><strong>Community:</strong> Social connection is strongest predictor of longevity; shared gardens create belonging</li>
      <li><strong>Microbiome:</strong> Fermented vegetables restore beneficial bacteria; high-fiber foods feed beneficial flora</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Compared to pharmaceutical approach</h3>
    <p>
      Antidepressants (SSRIs) work. But they also cause sexual dysfunction, weight gain, dependence.
      Gardening works—and builds health, community, and self-sufficiency simultaneously.
    </p>

    <h3>Timeline to results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> 2–4 weeks (morning light + activity)</li>
      <li><strong>Inflammation/pain:</strong> 4–12 weeks (turmeric + movement)</li>
      <li><strong>Mood/anxiety:</strong> 8–16 weeks (community + sunlight + movement)</li>
      <li><strong>Metabolic disease:</strong> 6–24 weeks (diet + movement)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Regions: Where This Matters Most</h2>

    <h3>Appalachia (WV, KY, PA, OH)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Crisis:</strong> Highest opioid + antidepressant rates nationally.
      <strong>Cause:</strong> Coal industry collapse, economic despair, limited pain management alternatives.
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Community gardens, opioid reduction clinics, cold-hardy plant education.
    </p>

    <h3>Deep South (LA, MS, AL, AR)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Crisis:</strong> Highest poverty + food desert rates; high antacid + antidepressant use.
      <strong>Cause:</strong> Limited healthcare access, processed food dependency, lack of affordable fresh food.
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Warm zones (8–9) enable year-round gardening. Family + community garden network.
    </p>

    <h3>Sunbelt (FL, AZ, NV)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Crisis:</strong> Aging populations with polypharmacy (5+ medications); highest antacid + pain med use.
      <strong>Cause:</strong> Isolation, sedentary aging, preventive overuse by clinicians.
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Community gardening reduces isolation; year-round growing maintains engagement.
    </p>

    <h3>Upper Midwest (OH, IN, IL, MI, WI)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Crisis:</strong> High depression + antacid rates; seasonal affective disorder; post-industrial despair.
      <strong>Cause:</strong> Winter darkness, economic decline, sedentary modern work.
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Winter gardening (greenhouses, root cellaring); indoor herb growing; community engagement.

    <h2>Faith Frontier's Role</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>We are not running another wellness program.</strong>
      We are overturning the tables. We are saying:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>Dependency is a design choice.</strong> Pharmaceutical companies benefit from 70% of Americans
        on prescription drugs. Food systems profit from obesity and disease. We reject this design.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stewardship is a returning.</strong> Humans evolved as gardeners. Jesus taught in gardens.
        The cure for disease is not in laboratories—it is in soil, sunlight, and neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We partner with clinicians, not against them.</strong> We show how medication reduction is possible
        when families garden, eat whole foods, move daily, and belong to community.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      <strong>At Tillerstead Sanctuary and FaithFrontier network churches, we will:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Teach zone-based gardening (free, public, multigenerational)</li>
      <li>Host clinician + gardener collaboration (deprescribing workshops)</li>
      <li>Document outcomes (BP, glucose, pain scores, medications reduced)</li>
      <li>Train community health workers (stewardship educators)</li>
      <li>Demonstrate that healing is cheaper, faster, and more joyful than pills</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Gospel of Healing</h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>"Then Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues,
        proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness."</em>
        —Matthew 9:35
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Healing is gospel work. Not as transaction (clinician → patient). As transformation (community → wholeness).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>This project demonstrates that:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pharmaceutical dependency is neither inevitable nor righteous</li>
      <li>Stewardship—growing food, moving, sleeping, belonging—is the primary healing practice</li>
      <li>Clinicians can partner with this without losing their authority</li>
      <li>Communities that garden heal faster and live longer</li>
      <li>Faith Frontier's role is to show the way home</li>
