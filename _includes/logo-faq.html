  <div class="ff-faq-item">
    <h3>What does the Faith Frontier logo represent?</h3>
    <p>
      It is a Christ-centered ecclesiastical seal that expresses our faith commitments and the order of Christian life:
      the Father’s authority, the Son’s redemption, and the Spirit’s renewing work—communicated through restrained form and color.
    </p>

  <div class="ff-faq-item">
    <h3>Is Faith Frontier a church or a nonprofit?</h3>
    <p>
      Faith Frontier is a faith-rooted stewardship project with theological convictions.
      Legal status depends on jurisdiction and formal filings, and we do not claim any civil classification
      unless and until it is formally established.
    </p>

  <div class="ff-faq-item">
    <h3>Why does Faith Frontier use “temple” language?</h3>
    <p>
      In Christian theology, Scripture teaches that the people of God are the temple—that God dwells not in buildings alone,
      but within His people (1 Corinthians 3:16–17).
    </p>
    <p>
      When Faith Frontier uses “temple” language, it is expressing a biblical understanding of spiritual identity,
      not making a legal, regulatory, or tax-related claim. Civil status is determined separately by applicable law.

  <div class="ff-faq-item">
    <h3>Why use a seal instead of a modern logo?</h3>
    <p>
      A seal communicates continuity, accountability, and seriousness of purpose.
      It signals a commitment to stewardship and public trust rather than trend-driven branding.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ff-faq-item">
    <h3>Can the logo be used publicly?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, when referencing Faith Frontier in good faith and using official assets.
      The logo must not be altered, recolored outside the approved palette, or used in misleading contexts.
