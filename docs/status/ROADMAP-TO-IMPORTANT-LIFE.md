  Subject: Free BWC Analysis Tool for Constitutional Defense

  Hi [Attorney Name],

  I'm Devon, the founder of Evident Legal Technologies. I built a platform
  that uses AI to analyze body-worn camera footage for constitutional violations
  (4th/5th Amendment issues, Miranda, Terry, Graham).

  I'm honoring the 1.3 million Americans who died defending the Constitution
  by making constitutional defense accessible to every attorney.

  For you: First month free, then $19/month (founding member rate).

  Features:
  - AI detects Miranda warnings, searches, seizures
  - Automatic transcript + timestamp sync
  - Direct links to Supreme Court precedent
  - Export briefs with case law citations

  Would you try it on your next BWC case?

  Truth is the only subject,
  Devon Tyler
  Founder, Evident Legal Technologies
  www.Evident.info

  - Offer Zoom call: Walk them through first upload
  - WhatsApp/Signal: Give them your direct number for support
  - Follow up daily for first week: "How's it going? Need help?"

- **Why This Doesn't Scale (And That's OK):**
  - You're building relationships, not just users
  - You're learning what attorneys actually need
  - You're creating evangelists (they'll tell other attorneys)
  - First 100 customers are your community, not revenue source

#### **6. Capture First Win**

- **When attorney wins a case using Evident:**
  - Interview them: "Tell me how you used it. What helped?"
  - Screenshot the motion: (with permission) show Evident citation
  - Case study: Write up the story
  - Share everywhere: Discord, website, social media
  - Honor them: Add to "Defenders" page - attorneys using Evident to win

- **First Win = Proof of Concept:**
  - Shows the platform works in real courts
  - Shows attorneys trust it
  - Shows constitutional defense is happening
  - Gives you something to sell: "Attorneys are winning cases with Evident"

  Subject: 28-year-old honors 1.3M war dead by building constitutional defense AI

  Hi [Journalist Name],

  I'm pitching a story about Devon Tyler, a 28-year-old developer from New Jersey
  who built an AI platform to defend the Constitution in court.

  Unique angle:
  - Platform analyzes police body camera footage for constitutional violations
  - Built-in archive of founding documents (independent of government sites)
  - Military honor installation (proper flag protocol, 1.3M deaths honored)
  - "By the Grace of Almighty God" - theological grounding of natural rights
  - First customer wins: [Specific case dismissed because of Evident analysis]

  This isn't just legal tech. It's a mission to preserve constitutional truth.

  Available for interview: Devon Tyler (founder, solo, bootstrapped)

  Happy to provide demo, screenshots, customer testimonials.

  Best,
  [Your PR contact or you directly]

# RISKS & MITIGATION

## **What Could Go Wrong:**

### **1. No Customers**

### **4. Competition**

- **Risk:** Big legal tech company copies Evident
- **Mitigation:**
  - Move fast (ship features weekly)

  - Mission differentiation (they're for profit, you're for Constitution)
  - Partnerships (lock in ACLU, law schools)

### **5. Financial Ruin**

- **Risk:** Run out of money before revenue
- **Mitigation:**
  - Bootstrap first year (live lean)
  - Grant applications (Month 12)

  - Keep 6 months runway always

### **6. Mission Drift**

- **Risk:** Compromise values for growth

# FINAL WORD: The Important Life

## **Devon, at 28, you have time.**

Most important work is built slowly, over decades:

- **Constitution:** 1787 → still defended today (237 years)
- **1.3M died:** 1775-2024 (249 years of sacrifice)
- **Your work:** 2026 → ? (just beginning)

## **What matters:**

1. **Daily faithfulness** - Show up, build, serve, repeat
2. **Long-term thinking** - You're building for 30 years, not 3
3. **Mission over metrics** - Impact > revenue
4. **Community over customers** - Relationships > transactions
5. **Truth over trends** - Constitution doesn't change, neither does your mission

## **By the Grace of Almighty God:**

- You honor the fallen by defending what they fought for
- You serve the people by making justice accessible
- You build with excellence because truth demands it
- You live an important life because your work matters

**"They fought for the Constitution. We preserve it. You defend it."**

This is not just a tagline.  
This is your life's work.  
This is your important life.
