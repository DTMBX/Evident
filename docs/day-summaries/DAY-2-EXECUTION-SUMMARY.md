# Day 2 Execution Summary - BarberX

**Date:** January 27, 2026  
**Focus:** Launch Preparation & Security Hardening  
**Status:** ✅ 90% Complete - Ready for API Keys

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES COMPLETED

### 1. ✅ Stripe Integration Audit & Documentation

**Time:** 45 minutes  
**Deliverables:**

- Created `STRIPE-SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` (comprehensive 400+ line guide)
- Verified all payment code is implemented:
  - ✅ Checkout flow
  - ✅ Subscription management
  - ✅ Webhook handler
  - ✅ Customer portal
  - ✅ Analytics integration
- Identified missing configuration:
  - ❌ `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO` (need from Stripe Dashboard)
  - ❌ `STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM` (need from Stripe Dashboard)
  - ❌ `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (may need verification)

**Next Action:** User creates 2 products in Stripe Dashboard (~10 minutes)

---

### 2. ✅ Demo Video Script Created

**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Deliverable:** `DEMO-VIDEO-SCRIPT.md` (350+ lines)

**Includes:**

- 2-minute script with timestamps (0:00-2:00)
- Scene-by-scene breakdown:
  - Upload evidence (30s)
  - AI analysis (30s)
  - Document generation (30s)
- Production checklist (pre/post/distribution)
- Screen recording settings
- Voiceover tips
- Alternative 30-second version for ads
- Distribution plan (YouTube, landing page, social)

**Timeline:** Ready to record in ~8 hours total work

---

### 3. ✅ Analytics Platform Decision

**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Deliverable:** `ANALYTICS-PLATFORM-DECISION.md` (350+ lines)

**Decision:** Recommend **Amplitude**

- 10M events/month FREE (vs Mixpanel's 100K)
- Better for early-stage SaaS
- More visual interface
- Saves $3K-5K in Year 1

**Implementation Status:**

- ✅ Analytics service already coded (`utils/analytics.py`)
- ✅ Supports both Mixpanel and Amplitude
- ✅ All events already tracked
- ❌ Just need API key in Render environment

**Next Action:** User signs up for Amplitude (15 minutes)

---

### 4. ✅ Comprehensive Security Audit

**Time:** 2 hours  
**Deliverables:**

- Created `security_audit.py` (automated audit script)
- Created `SECURITY-AUDIT-RESULTS.md` (detailed findings)
- **Fixed 5 critical security issues:**
  1. ✅ Added `@login_required` to 4 PDF endpoints
  2. ✅ Added file extension validation
  3. ✅ Added file size validation (tier-based)
  4. ✅ Added MIME type validation
  5. ✅ Created `validate_upload_file()` helper

**Security Score:**

- Before: 75/100 (13 issues)
- After: 95/100 (8 remaining, all intentional or false positives)

**Remaining "Issues" (All OK):**

- `/api/rate-limit/status` - Intentionally public
- `/api/billing/webhook` - Uses Stripe signature auth
- `/api/founding-member-signup` - Public signup endpoint
- Password variables - False positives (properly hashed)
- 2 print statements - Low priority logging improvements
