## Case Overview

This Special Civil Part matter involves toll-enforcement collection claims brought against the Defendant. Notably, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) has raised its claimed damages to over $8,000 for an alleged $365 in unpaid tolls, asserting authority to collect under New Jersey law and citing the appellate case Long v. NJTA. However, this case is not applicable to the Defendant's situation, as the Defendant is not Long, but Devon, who is enrolled in EA and government assistance programs and is actively engaged in sustained efforts to live a civil, lawful life. The Defendant asserts that actions by certain state actors in New Jersey have made this extremely difficult.

The Defendant has asserted counterclaims and affirmative defenses challenging the integrity of the enforcement process, the accuracy of toll data, and barriers to meaningful access and participation in court proceedings.

The record reflects ongoing disputes concerning service, proof of liability, discovery compliance, and the provision of reasonable accommodations necessary for a fair hearing.
