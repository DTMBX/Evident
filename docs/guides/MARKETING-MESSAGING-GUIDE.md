## Why We Exist (Website Language)

### The Problem

**Legal research costs $2,000 per month.**

For decades, Westlaw and LexisNexis have charged prices that:

- **Exclude 80% of solo practitioners** who can't afford enterprise tools
- **Bankrupt legal aid organizations** serving those who need help most
- **Block law students** from practicing research after graduation
- **Widen the justice gap** between well-funded firms and everyone else

### The Solution

**Professional research at human prices.**

Evident provides the same primary sources, citation analysis, and research tools used by BigLaw—for **$50/month** instead of $2,000.

### The Impact

**When legal research becomes affordable:**

- Solo practitioners compete with BigLaw
- Public defenders get professional tools
- Law students graduate practice-ready
- Justice becomes accessible, not theoretical

## How We Plan to Win

### Strategy 1: Research-Grade Quality

We don't compromise. Evident provides **10 million+ federal opinions** spanning **270 years**—the same primary sources BigLaw uses.

**Result:** Research quality that rivals the incumbents, at a fraction of the cost.

### Strategy 2: Next-Generation Technology

While legacy platforms rely on 1990s infrastructure, we're building with cutting-edge AI:

- Shepardize™ equivalent (citation network analysis)
- Judge intelligence (backgrounds, voting patterns)
- AI-powered research (ChatGPT integration)
- Predictive analytics (case outcome modeling)

**Result:** Features that didn't exist five years ago—now available to every attorney.

### Strategy 3: Radical Cost Disruption

We're not "a little cheaper"—we're **20x cheaper**:

- Westlaw: $500-2,000/month → Evident: $50-200/month
- PACER: $0.10/page → Evident: FREE
- Annual cost: $6,000-24,000 → Evident: $600-2,400

**Result:** Professional research accessible to solo practitioners, legal aid, and students.

### Strategy 4: Open Access Mission

We believe legal research is infrastructure for justice—not a luxury good:

- Free tier for everyone
- Deep discounts for legal aid
- Affordable student access
- Law school partnerships
- Transparent methodology

**Result:** A sustainable business that prioritizes access over extraction.
