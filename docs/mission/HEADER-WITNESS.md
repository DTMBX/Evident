## Constitutional Standard and Memorial Installation

**Builder:** Devon Tyler (28, New Jersey, USA)  
**Purpose:** Standing witness to constitutional foundation

## PROCLAMATION

Let a Header Be Set as Witness.

Establish a unified mark at the summit of the site, constituted as a quiet standard and not an ornament, wherein symbols are placed by order, proportion, and intent. Let the principal banner stand first and unaltered, as recognized by Law and Measure, holding precedence by right, seniority, and covenant.

All accompanying standards shall be rendered subordinate in scale and revelation, grouped as one body, revealed only by consent or inquiry, so that none contend with the First nor obscure its charge. No symbol shall be diminished, dramatized, or falsely adorned; each shall appear as record, not spectacle.

This component shall operate as a standing clause:

- **Binding by hierarchy** — US Flag supreme position
- **Governed by restraint** — No animation, no spectacle
- **Accessible to those who seek** — Click to reveal subordinate flags
- **Silent to those who pass** — Discrete, not imposing

Let spacing be deliberate, alignment square, and color truthful. Let nothing move that should stand. Let nothing shout that was meant to testify.

By this design, truth is preserved, order is maintained, and all contained herein is held in good faith, under the Light, and under the Son—set apart for remembrance, protection, and lawful continuity.

## WITNESS SEAL (Short Version)

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

**From the Proclamation:**

> "Let the principal banner stand first and unaltered, as recognized by Law and Measure, holding precedence by right, seniority, and covenant."

**Interpretation:**

- US Flag = Principal banner
- First = Leftmost position
- Unaltered = No animations, exact colors
- Law = Title 4 USC
- Measure = Proper dimensions
- Precedence = Always supreme

> "No symbol shall be diminished, dramatized, or falsely adorned; each shall appear as record, not spectacle."

**Interpretation:**

- No animations = Not dramatized
- Accurate colors = Not falsely adorned
- Static display = Record, not spectacle
- Discrete panel = Restraint, not show

> "Let nothing move that should stand. Let nothing shout that was meant to testify."

**Interpretation:**

- No animations on flags
- No flashy effects
- Quiet witness
- Testimony through presence, not performance
