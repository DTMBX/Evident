## New Jersey One-Party Consent Rule

### What It Means

New Jersey law allows you to record conversations **where you are a
participant** without telling the other person.

**Legal Citation:**

- N.J.S.A. 2A:156A-3 (Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act)
- "Intercept" defined as acquisition by device **without consent of at least one
  party**

**Plain English:** If you're part of the conversation, you can record it. If
you're not part of it, you need consent from all parties.

### Examples

✅ **LAWFUL:**

- Recording your own traffic stop
- Recording a conversation with a police officer who pulled you over
- Recording a public meeting where you're present

❌ **ILLEGAL:**

- Hiding a recorder in someone else's office
- Recording your neighbor's private phone call
- Using hidden cameras in private spaces

## Recording Police in Public

### Your Constitutional Right

The **First Amendment protects your right to record police** performing official
duties in public places.

**Key Case Law:**

- _Glik v. Cunniffe_ (1st Cir. 2011) - "a citizen's right to film government
  officials...is a basic, vital, and well-established liberty"
- _ACLU v. Alvarez_ (7th Cir. 2012) - Recording police in public is protected
  speech
- _Fields v. City of Philadelphia_ (3rd Cir. 2017) - NJ is in 3rd Circuit
  jurisdiction

**NJ Attorney General Guidance:** The NJ AG has issued directives recognizing
the public's right to record police activities in public.

### What "In Public" Means

✅ **Public spaces:**

- Streets and sidewalks
- Parks
- Public buildings (lobbies, council chambers)
- Publicly accessible areas

⚠️ **Private property:**

- Someone else's home
- Business property (owner can ask you to leave)
- Restricted areas (inside police station, courthouse secure areas)

### Interference is Separate

**You can record, but you CANNOT:**

- Physically obstruct police activities
- Ignore lawful orders to step back
- Interfere with an arrest or investigation
- Create a safety hazard

**Legal Consequence:** Interfering with police duties is a **separate criminal
offense** (N.J.S.A. 2C:29-1 Obstruction).

**Best Practice:**

- Keep reasonable distance (generally 10-15 feet)
- Follow lawful orders to move
- Don't touch officers or their equipment
- Speak calmly if addressed

## When Recording Can Be Illegal

### Criminal or Tortious Purpose

Even if consent rules allow recording, using recordings for illegal purposes
creates exposure:

❌ **Illegal purposes:**

- Blackmail or extortion
- Harassment or stalking
- Invasion of privacy torts
- Evidence tampering

**Example:** Recording someone in public is usually legal, but following them
repeatedly to record them could be stalking.

### Invasion of Privacy

New Jersey recognizes **intrusion upon seclusion** as a tort.

**Test:**

1. Intentional intrusion (physical or otherwise)
2. Into private affairs or concerns
3. That would be highly offensive to a reasonable person

**Examples:**

- Recording through someone's window
- Using telephoto lens to capture private moments
- Recording in bathroom/changing room

## Barber Cam Safety Guidelines

### Before Recording

**Ask Yourself:**

1. ✅ Am I in a public place?
2. ✅ Am I documenting something I'm witnessing or involved in?
3. ✅ Is my purpose to preserve accurate evidence?
4. ❌ Am I trying to provoke or escalate?
5. ❌ Am I trespassing or violating someone's privacy?

### During Recording

**De-Escalation First:**

- Remain calm and polite
- Follow lawful orders
- Keep safe distance
- Don't argue about your rights mid-encounter
- Document, don't debate

**If Asked to Stop:**

- Politely assert: "I'm exercising my right to record in public"
- Don't get into extended debate
- If ordered to leave private property, comply
- If detained, assert your rights and request an attorney

### After Recording

**Preserve Evidence:**

- Don't edit or alter the original recording
- Upload to Barber Cam immediately (automatic hashing)
- Keep multiple backups
- Document: date, time, location, who was present

**Do Not:**

- Post on social media before consulting counsel
- Share selectively edited clips (undermines credibility)
- Threaten to "expose" people with the recording
- Use footage for commercial purposes without consent

## Special Situations

### Traffic Stops

✅ **You may:**

- Record video and audio of the traffic stop
- Inform the officer you're recording (optional but recommended)
- Keep your phone visible (reduces suspicion)

⚠️ **You must:**

- Keep hands visible
- Provide license/registration/insurance when requested
- Follow lawful orders (step out of car, etc.)
- Not use recording as excuse to refuse compliance

### Protests and Public Gatherings

✅ **Generally allowed:**

- Recording events in public spaces
- Documenting police actions at protests
- Live-streaming (protected speech)

⚠️ **Risks:**

- Dispersal orders must be followed
- Recording doesn't exempt you from curfews
- Trespassing laws still apply

### Private Businesses

⚠️ **Business owners can:**

- Prohibit recording on their property
- Ask you to leave if you refuse to stop
- Call police for trespassing if you refuse to leave

✅ **You can:**

- Record from public sidewalk outside
- Record brief interactions (entering store, asking question)
- Leave if asked, then file complaint or review online

## What to Do If Detained or Arrested

### Your Rights

1. **Remain silent** - Don't explain or justify the recording
2. **Request an attorney** - Say: "I want my lawyer"
3. **Don't consent to searches** - Say: "I do not consent to searches"
4. **Don't resist** - Comply physically, assert rights verbally

### Protecting Your Recording

**Phone Locks:**

- Use strong passcode (not fingerprint - can be compelled)
- Enable auto-upload to cloud (Barber Cam does this)
- Know your phone's emergency lockdown feature

**Legal:**

- Courts have ruled police generally **cannot force you to unlock your phone**
  without a warrant
- 5th Amendment protects passcodes (testimonial)
- Biometrics (fingerprint/face) have weaker protection in some jurisdictions

**If Phone is Seized:**

- Ask for a receipt
- Note: badge number, time, location
- Contact attorney immediately
- File motion for return of property if not charged
