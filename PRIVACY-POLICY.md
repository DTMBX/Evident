# Privacy Policy - BarberX Legal Tech Platform

**Effective Date:** January 22, 2026  
**Last Updated:** January 22, 2026

## Our Commitment to Privacy

BarberX Legal Tech is designed with **privacy-first** principles. Unlike traditional eDiscovery platforms that upload your evidence to the cloud, **all AI processing happens 100% locally on your computer**. Your case files, BWC videos, and documents **never leave your machine**.

This Privacy Policy explains what limited data we do collect (account information only), how we use it, and your rights.
