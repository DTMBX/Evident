# Pain + Nerve Support (Food-first)

This subguide supports nerve irritation and musculoskeletal pain through
**low-risk, daily practices**.

## Start here

  chamomile/lavender (evening)
- Gentle movement: frequent short walks; avoid long sitting
- Topical support: rosemary/ginger infused oil massage (hips/glutes/back)

## Plants commonly used (zone-dependent)

Use the filter: **/health/holistic/**  
Select condition: **Pain + Nerve Support** and your USDA zone.

## Cautions

- Do not stop or change prescriptions without clinician collaboration.
- Avoid concentrated extracts early; start with food, tea, and topical.
