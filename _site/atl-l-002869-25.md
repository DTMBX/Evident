  ## Case Overview

This Law Division action is brought by Plaintiff **Devon Tyler Barber** against **CarMax** and related entities. The action seeks declaratory and equitable relief to resolve disputes concerning vehicle ownership, title status, and indemnity obligations arising from the sale, registration, and subsequent use of vehicle records for enforcement and administrative purposes.

Plaintiff alleges that inaccurate, inconsistent, or improperly maintained vehicle records resulted in enforcement actions and legal exposure inconsistent with the true ownership and contractual allocation of responsibility. The action seeks a judicial declaration clarifying ownership, liability, and indemnity rights.

## Core Issues Presented

- Whether Plaintiff retained ownership or legal responsibility for the vehicle at issue following the transaction with CarMax;
- Whether title and registration records accurately reflected the parties’ rights and obligations;
- Whether Defendants bear indemnity or corrective obligations arising from errors or omissions in vehicle-transfer documentation;
- Whether declaratory and equitable relief is necessary to prevent continued or future enforcement based on erroneous records.

## Procedural Posture

- **14 Oct 2025:** Verified Complaint filed, accompanied by an indigency affidavit, initiating the Law Division action.
- **17 Oct 2025:** Track Assignment Notice issued recognizing the declaratory nature of the action; Plaintiff requested reassignment consistent with comparable Track 3 matters.
- **29 Oct 2025:** Amended Complaint filed clarifying requests for declaratory relief, related damages, and constitutional claims tied to enforcement consequences.
- **Ongoing:** Proofs of service, responses, and discussions concerning corrective action and indemnity remain in progress; no final dispositive orders have issued.
