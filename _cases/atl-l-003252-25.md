# ATL-L-003252-25 – Equitable Relief

## Case Overview

**Docket No.:** ATL-L-003252-25  
**Court:** Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Civil Part – Atlantic County  
**Plaintiff:** Devon Tyler Barber (pro se)  
**Defendants:** Township of Hamilton; Officer Edward Ruiz; Officer Bryan Merritt; Officer Cristian Martin; Officer Kyle McKnight; Officer Rachel Hare; Sergeant Dennis Bakker; Sergeant Gary Clune; Officer Nijon Isom  
**Case Type:** Civil Action – Verified Complaint & Order to Show Cause (Emergency Injunctive Relief)  
**Primary Relief Sought:** Immediate return of unlawfully impounded vehicle; declaratory and equitable relief

### Pattern and Supplemental Discovery

This case arises from a pattern of conduct by the Township of Hamilton Police Department. Notably, this is the same department (but a different chief and all different officers) as involved in Plaintiff's 2024 incident with Officer Boyd. The present matter involves Officer Ruiz and others, but demonstrates similar issues regarding police conduct, lack of transparency, and disregard for due process. Plaintiff is seeking supplemental discovery to establish this pattern and practice—not to relitigate prior incidents, but to show the existence of a systemic issue relevant to the claims and relief sought here.

In this incident, Officer Ruiz forcibly removed Plaintiff from his vehicle without explanation, despite Plaintiff's civil demeanor and requests for clarification. Body-worn camera (BWC) footage reveals a prolonged stop (approximately 20 minutes before returning to Plaintiff's window), during which Officer Ruiz prevented others from communicating with Plaintiff and manipulated the sequence of events. These actions, along with the department's refusal to release the vehicle absent payment of fees, support Plaintiff's request for equitable and declaratory relief and further discovery into departmental practices.

### Nature of the Action

This is an **emergent civil action** seeking immediate injunctive and equitable relief under **R. 4:52-1** and **R. 4:67-1**. Plaintiff challenges the seizure and continued retention of his **2019 Volkswagen Passat (NJ Plate F35VLP)**, which was taken and held without statutory authority, court order, forfeiture process, or constitutionally adequate due process.

### Core Facts

- On **November 29, 2025**, Hamilton Township police officers seized Plaintiff's vehicle following a traffic stop and custodial arrest.
- The arrest resulted in municipal-level charges (including disorderly conduct, obstruction, and resisting arrest), **none of which authorize vehicle impoundment** under Title 39 or any forfeiture statute.
- The vehicle was **operable, legally parked, not contraband, not evidence, and posed no public-safety hazard** at the time of seizure.
- **No forfeiture complaint, warrant, inventory, or judicial order** has ever been issued authorizing continued retention of the vehicle.
- The **Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office confirmed in writing** that it possesses **no 911 call, CAD entry, dispatch record, or call-for-service documentation** supporting either the stop or the impoundment.
- Defendants have refused to release the vehicle unless towing and storage fees are paid, despite the impoundment being **unlawful ab initio**.

These facts are set forth in sworn certifications and a verified complaint filed with the Court.
